  "explanation": "I\u2019m not aware of a notable EA/rationalist author named 'CyrilB' (and the name doesn\u2019t match well-known EA figures like MacAskill, Ord, Singer, Bostrom, etc.). There\u2019s no record in major EA venues (EA Forum, LessWrong, 80,000 Hours) or mainstream academic/press outlets up to mid\u20112024. If this is a niche or purely pseudonymous poster on small forums, their prominence appears minimal."
