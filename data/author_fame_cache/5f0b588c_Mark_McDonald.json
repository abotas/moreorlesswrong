  "explanation": "Mark McDonald is a common name and (as of my 2024-06 knowledge cutoff) there is no well-known EA/rationalist figure by that name. I am not aware of major EA writings, talks, or roles tied to this name; globally the name does appear for various professionals/authors but not as a widely recognized public figure. If you can share links or works attributed to this Mark McDonald, I can reassess."
