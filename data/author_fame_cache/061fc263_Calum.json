  "explanation": "Name too ambiguous to identify a single author. No widely known EA/rationalist figure or globally prominent writer who goes only by 'Calum' is readily identifiable. If you mean a specific person (e.g., Calum Miller, Calum Chace, etc.), provide the full name or links and I can reassess."
