  "explanation": "The name 'Tee' is too short/generic to identify a distinct EA/rationalist author and I don't recognize a widely-known figure by that name. No evidence of a prominent role in EA or broader public discourse under this single-word handle. If you can supply a link, full pseudonym, or sample work, I can give a more specific rating."
