  "explanation": "I am not aware of a well-known EA/rationalist author named Aaron Bergman up to my 2024-06 cutoff. There is no prominent presence on major EA/rationalist venues (EA Forum, LessWrong, 80,000 Hours) or obvious high-profile publications/citations tied to that name. He appears to be either unknown in EA circles or a very minor/occasional contributor; globally he has no notable public profile. If you have links or context (articles, social accounts, pseudonym details), I can reassess."
