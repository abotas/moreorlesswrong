  "explanation": "I am not aware of a widely recognized EA/rationalist author named \u2018Arkose\u2019 (up to my 2024-06 knowledge cutoff). The name does not correspond to a central or well-known contributor, nor to major publications or talks within EA circles. It appears to be a pseudonym or a minor/obscure online handle with no notable global public presence."
