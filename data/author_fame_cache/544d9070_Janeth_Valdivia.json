  "explanation": "I can't identify a notable person named Janeth Valdivia in EA/rationalist communities or as a globally recognized public figure as of mid\u20112024. The name does not appear linked to major EA publications, speakers, or widely cited work; it may be a private individual or pseudonym. If you have more context (links, field, works), I can reassess."
