  "explanation": "I have no evidence that a writer called 'flyingtiger' is a recognized figure within the EA/rationalist community or in wider public discourse. The name appears to be a pseudonymous handle with little or no prominent presence in major EA forums, publications, or mainstream media. If you can provide links or context (forum posts, articles, platform), I can reassess."
