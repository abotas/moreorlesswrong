  "explanation": "I could not identify a clearly prominent EA/rationalist author named 'Bob Fischer'. The name is common and could be a pseudonym; there is no clear evidence of substantial posts, talks, or leadership in EA/rationalist circles, nor any notable global public profile. If you can share links or more context, I can reassess."
