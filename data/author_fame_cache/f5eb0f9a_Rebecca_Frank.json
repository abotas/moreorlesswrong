  "explanation": "I am not aware of a well-known EA/rationalist author named Rebecca Frank \u2014 the name does not correspond to any central or recognised EA speaker, writer, or organizer. Globally the name appears common and may belong to several private individuals or minor online authors, but there is no clear evidence of wide public prominence. If you can provide a link, affiliation, or notable works, I can reassess more accurately."
