  "explanation": "I could not find a recognizable EA/rationalist presence or traceable public profile for an author named \u201cJames-Sullivan\u201d (hyphenated) in major EA outlets, LessWrong, 80,000 Hours, OpenPhil, academic databases, or mainstream media. It may be a pseudonym or a private/obscure account; therefore they appear unknown both within EA and to the broader public."
