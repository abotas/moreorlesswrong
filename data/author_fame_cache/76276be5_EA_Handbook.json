  "explanation": "\"EA Handbook\" appears to be a collective/resource title or pseudonymous/organizational author (a guide for newcomers) rather than a single prominent individual. It is reasonably known within EA/rationalist circles as a reference but not a well\u2011known author or frequent public figure; it has virtually no recognition outside the EA community."
