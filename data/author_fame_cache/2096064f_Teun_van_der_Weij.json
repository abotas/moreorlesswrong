  "explanation": "I am not aware of a notable EA/rationalist figure named Teun van der Weij; the name does not appear among well-known EA authors/speakers or on prominent EA platforms (LessWrong, 80,000 Hours, CEA, Open Philanthropy). Globally there\u2019s little evidence of wide public recognition\u2014at most a minor online/academic footprint or a private individual; not a publicly prominent author."
