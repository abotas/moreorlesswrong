  "explanation": "I find no clear public record of 'Aditya Arpitha Prasad' in major EA/rationalist outlets (EA Forum, LessWrong, 80,000 Hours, OpenPhil) or in academic indexes and major social media as of my knowledge cutoff; likely an unknown or private individual (possibly a pseudonym). If you need confirmation, check Google, Google Scholar, LinkedIn, and EA community search tools for any recent activity."
