  "explanation": "I have no evidence up to my 2024-06 knowledge cutoff that an author named Ihor Ivliev (or that exact pseudonym) is a known figure in the EA/rationalist community or widely recognized publicly. There are no prominent publications, organizational affiliations, or frequent citations/speaking engagements tied to that name; it appears to be either obscure, a private individual, or a pseudonym with no notable public profile."
