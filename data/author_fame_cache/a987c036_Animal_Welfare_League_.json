  "explanation": "\u201cAnimal Welfare League\u201d reads like the name of an organization (often local animal-rescue groups) rather than a known individual author or EA/rationalist figure. It is effectively unknown in EA/rationalist circles. Such groups have a minor/local online presence within animal-welfare communities but are not broadly known or influential globally."
