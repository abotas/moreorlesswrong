  "explanation": "I don't recognize a prominent EA/rationalist author named 'Vinoj' and they do not appear among well-known EA Forum/LessWrong/80,000 Hours/academic or public-facing authors. The name may be a pseudonym or a less-visible contributor; please provide links or context if you have them and I can re-assess."
