  "explanation": "The name Joseph Richardson is common and I can\u2019t find a clearly identifiable, widely cited author by that name in EA/rationalist circles \u2014 no evidence of prominence, frequent speaking, or major publications in that community. Globally there are people with that name in various fields, but none that are widely known public figures; if you can provide a link, publication title, or more context I can give a more specific assessment."
