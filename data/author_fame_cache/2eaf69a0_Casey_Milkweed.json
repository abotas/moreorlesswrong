  "explanation": "As of my 2024-06 knowledge cutoff I am not aware of an author named Casey Milkweed in EA/rationalist circles or the broader public. There are no notable publications, talks, or profiles tied to that name in major EA/rationalist venues (LessWrong, 80k, FHI, CEA) or in mainstream sources. It could be a new or pseudonymous author active on small or anonymous platforms."
