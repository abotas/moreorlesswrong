  "explanation": "I cannot find evidence that 'Ville Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4' is a known figure in the EA/rationalist community or a publicly prominent author up to my 2024-06 cutoff. The name does not appear as a recognizable EA speaker, frequent contributor, or widely cited public intellectual; it may be a private person or pseudonym. If you have links or context (works, affiliations, platforms), I can reassess."
