  "explanation": "Assuming this is James Herbert the British horror novelist (1943\u20132013): he is essentially unknown as a figure within EA/rationalist circles (1). Globally he is a well-known author within the horror/UK literary scene, sold millions of books and has lasting recognition among genre readers but is not a mainstream global household name (around 6). If you meant a different James Herbert (e.g., an EA pseudonym), please specify."
