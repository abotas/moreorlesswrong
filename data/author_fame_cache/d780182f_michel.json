  "explanation": "The single name 'michel' (possibly a pseudonym) is too ambiguous to identify a specific person. With no additional context (surname, works, platform, or community links) there is no recognizable presence in EA/rationalist circles or globally. Provide more details (full name, sample work, where they publish) and I can reassess."
