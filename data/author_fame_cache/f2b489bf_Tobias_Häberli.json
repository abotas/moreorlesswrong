  "explanation": "I am not aware of Tobias H\u00e4berli being a known figure in the effective-altruism or rationalist communities, nor as a public figure more broadly up to my 2024-06 knowledge cutoff. The name yields little/no notable public footprint in major EA/rationalist outlets or mainstream media; it may be a private individual or a pseudonym. If you can provide links or context I can reassess."
