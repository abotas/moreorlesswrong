  "explanation": "Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE) is an organization, not an individual. It is well known and influential within the effective altruism and effective animal advocacy communities for its charity evaluations and recommendations, and regularly engages with EA audiences \u2014 hence a high EA-community rating. It is less known to the general public but recognized within animal-welfare and philanthropic/professional circles, so a moderate global rating."
