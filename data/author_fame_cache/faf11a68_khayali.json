  "explanation": "I am not aware of any prominent EA/rationalist figure or widely cited author using the name \u201ckhayali.\u201d It appears to be a pseudonymous/obscure username (possibly on forums) with no clear record of major publications, talks, or influence in EA circles or the wider public. If you can share links or more context (real name, venues they publish in), I can reassess."
