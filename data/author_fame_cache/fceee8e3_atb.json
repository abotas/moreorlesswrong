  "explanation": "Insufficient identifying information. There is no clearly-recognized EA/rationalist figure or globally-known author who is broadly known simply as \u201catb.\u201d Assuming no further context or links, treat this as an unknown/pseudonymous author. If you can provide a link, sample work, or platform (LessWrong, EA Forum, Twitter, etc.), I can reassess."
