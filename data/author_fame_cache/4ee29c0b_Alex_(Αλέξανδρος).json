  "explanation": "Insufficient identifying information. 'Alex (\u0391\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2)' is a very common name/pseudonym and I cannot find a clearly identifiable author with notable presence in EA/rationalist circles or the wider public. Provide a link, works, or more details to reassess."
