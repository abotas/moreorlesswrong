  "explanation": "I found no evidence that a notable EA/rationalist author or public figure goes by 'EAvalues\ud83d\udd38'. That looks like a pseudonymous or small social\u2011media account; it does not appear in major EA venues (EA Forum, LessWrong, 80,000 Hours, EA publications) nor has global public recognition. If you can share links or examples of their work, I can reassess."
