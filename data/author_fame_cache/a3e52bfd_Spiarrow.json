  "explanation": "I could not find evidence that 'Spiarrow' is a known figure in the EA/rationalist community or more broadly \u2014 no prominent publications, talks, or leadership roles tied to that name. Likely a pseudonymous or minor online author with little-to-no public recognition. If you can share links or context (platform, notable pieces), I can reassess."
