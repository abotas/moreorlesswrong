  "explanation": "I could not find evidence of a notable EA/rationalist author named \"Alistair Stewart\"; the name is common and could be a pseudonym, but it is not recognized as a contributor, speaker, or cited figure within EA/rationalist circles. There is a similarly named UK newscaster (Alastair Stewart) who is a public figure in British media, which may cause confusion, but that person is not a central EA figure. If you have sample works or links, I can reassess more precisely."
