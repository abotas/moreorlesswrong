  "explanation": "I cannot find evidence that 'Howl404' is a recognized author or public figure in the Effective Altruism/rationalist communities or more broadly. The handle does not match any well-known EA Forum, LessWrong, academic, or mainstream publications up to mid-2024; it appears to be an obscure or pseudonymous online handle. If this is a recent alias or a niche-community user, ratings could differ with more context or links to their work."
