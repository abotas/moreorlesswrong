  "explanation": "As of my 2024-06 knowledge cutoff, I find no notable presence for 'Rauno Arike' in EA/rationalist venues (LessWrong, EA Forum, 80,000 Hours, OpenPhil) or in academic/public media records. Likely a private individual, pseudonym, or very minor/obscure contributor with minimal public footprint."
