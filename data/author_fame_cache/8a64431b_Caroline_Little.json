  "explanation": "I am not aware of any well-known EA/rationalist figure named Caroline Little; the name does not appear among frequent contributors, speakers, or authors in EA forums (LessWrong, EA Forum, 80,000 Hours, etc.). Globally the name appears to have low visibility and likely refers to private individuals or niche authors rather than a public figure \u2014 could also be a pseudonym, but there is no clear public footprint indicating broad recognition."
