  "explanation": "Giving What We Can is a well-known EA-affiliated organization (founded by Toby Ord in 2009) that runs the 10% giving pledge and is widely recognized within the effective altruism/rationalist community. It is an organization/brand rather than an individual author or a global public figure, and has limited general-public recognition outside philanthropy/EA circles."
