  "explanation": "I have no record (up to my 2024-06 cutoff) of an author or pseudonym 'ENAIS' being a known figure in the EA/rationalist community or the wider public. No notable posts, talks, publications, or citations under that name appeared in the sources I was trained on. If you can provide links or context (where you saw this name), I can reassess."
