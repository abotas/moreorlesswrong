  "explanation": "I could find no evidence that 'Agust\u00edn Covarrubias \ud83d\udd38' is a known figure in the EA/rationalist community or more broadly \u2014 no prominent publications, organizational affiliations, frequent posts/speeches, or citations. The name may be a pseudonym or a private/low\u2011visibility account; overall there is no clear public presence or prominence."
