  "explanation": "There is no well-known EA/rationalist figure widely recognized as 'Babel'. The name appears to be a pseudonym or a very minor/obscure author with limited or niche presence (if any) on community forums; essentially no mainstream or global public recognition. If you have a link or more context (where they publish, sample work), I can reassess."
