  "explanation": "I cannot identify a notable EA/rationalist presence for the name 'Lydia Nottingham' up to my 2024-06 cutoff. There are no well-known publications, talks, or community roles tied to that name in EA circles, nor evidence of broad public recognition. If this is a pseudonym or very recent/emerging author, share links or context and I can reassess."
