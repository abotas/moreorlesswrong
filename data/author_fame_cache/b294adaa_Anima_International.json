  "explanation": "I found no evidence that 'Anima International' is a known author or pseudonym in EA/rationalist spaces (EA Forum, LessWrong, major EA publications) or among public intellectuals. The name more commonly refers to an animal-protection NGO in some regions; there is no visible authorial footprint or citations. If you can share links or context (a specific article, forum post, or bio), I can reassess."
