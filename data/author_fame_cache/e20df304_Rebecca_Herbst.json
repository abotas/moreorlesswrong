  "explanation": "No notable presence in Effective Altruism/rationalist communities (not a known contributor or speaker). There is a public figure named Rebecca Herbst (an American TV actress best known for a long-running role on the soap 'General Hospital'), which gives modest recognition among soap audiences but not broad global prominence as an author or public intellectual. If this is a different person using the same name or a pseudonym, provide more context and I can reassess."
