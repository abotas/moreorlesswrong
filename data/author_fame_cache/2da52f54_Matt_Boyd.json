  "explanation": "Matt Boyd is a common name and I am not aware of a widely recognized EA/rationalist figure by that name up to my 2024-06 cutoff. No clear association with major EA organizations, publications, or public-facing work; likely unknown in EA circles and not globally famous. If you can supply context (links, works, or affiliation), I can reassess."
