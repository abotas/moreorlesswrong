  "explanation": "I am not aware of a notable EA/rationalist author named Cody Albert and there are no well-known publications, talks, or citations under that name in major EA/rationalist venues or in broader public media. Likely a private individual, pseudonym, or minor online presence. If you can provide links or context (papers, posts, handles), I can reassess."
