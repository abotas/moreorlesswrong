  "explanation": "The single name 'Sanjay' is too ambiguous to identify a specific author. Without a surname, works, links, or context, there is no evidence of recognition within the EA/rationalist community or the broader public. Provide more identifying details (surname, notable works, affiliation, or links) for a meaningful assessment."
