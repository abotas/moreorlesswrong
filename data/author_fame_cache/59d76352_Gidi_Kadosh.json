  "explanation": "I can find no evidence that 'Gidi Kadosh' is a recognized name in the EA/rationalist community or in wider public discourse up to my 2024-06 knowledge cutoff. The name does not appear in major EA outlets (LessWrong, EA Forum, 80,000 Hours, CEA), academic citation databases, or mainstream media as a notable author; it may be a private individual, minor online persona, or a pseudonym."
