  "explanation": "No widely known EA/rationalist author named \u2018Tyler Williams\u2019 could be identified; the name is common and may be a pseudonym. Absent links or context, there is no evidence of prominence within EA circles and only a very small general online presence. If you provide a URL or sample work, I can reassess more precisely."
