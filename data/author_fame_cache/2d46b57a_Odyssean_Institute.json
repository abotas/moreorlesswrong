  "explanation": "Odyssean Institute appears to be an obscure or pseudonymous author/organization with little visible presence in mainstream EA/rationalist channels (few/no widely cited posts, talks, or affiliations). Not recognized as a regular or prominent EA contributor and has no notable public profile outside niche/online spaces. If you have links or works, I can reassess."
