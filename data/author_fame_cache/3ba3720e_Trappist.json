  "explanation": "There is no clear public profile for an author known simply as \u201cTrappist.\u201d If this is a pseudonymous user, they do not appear to be a recognized/central figure in the EA or rationalist communities (at most a niche/occasional contributor), and they have essentially no global public presence. Assessment made with limited identifying information and may change if you provide links or context to specific writings."
