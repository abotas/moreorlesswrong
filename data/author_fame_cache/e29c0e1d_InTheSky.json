  "explanation": "I could not find evidence that an author known as 'InTheSky' is a recognized figure in the EA/rationalist community or more broadly. The name appears to be a pseudonymous username with no widely cited publications, talks, or major posts tied to it. If you can provide links or context (forum, article, platform), I can reassess."
