  "explanation": "I find no evidence that Iska Knuuttila is known within EA/rationalist circles or as a public figure more broadly. The name does not appear among well-known EA authors, forum contributors, or major academic/media sources. It may be a pseudonym or a private/obscure individual; provide links if you want a re-assessment."
