  "explanation": "Ian Turner is a common name and I could not find a clearly identifiable, prominent author by that name in the EA/rationalist community. No widely-cited EA posts, talks, or major publications tied to an Ian Turner are apparent; globally the name has minor online presence across different people. If you mean a specific Ian Turner (link, book title, affiliation), I can reassess."
