  "explanation": "\u2018Forecasting Research Institute\u2019 appears to be a small or possibly pseudonymous entity with little visibility in mainstream EA/rationalist circles. It is not widely recognized like Metaculus, Good Judgment, or FHI, and there is minimal public or academic presence attributable to that exact name. If you can share links or specific works, I can reassess."
