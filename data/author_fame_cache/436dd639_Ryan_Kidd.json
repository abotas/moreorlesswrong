  "explanation": "I cannot find evidence that a writer named Ryan Kidd is a known figure in the EA/rationalist community or more broadly. The name is common (including a former English footballer), and there are no clear high-profile publications, talks, or leadership roles in EA forums, LessWrong, EA Forum, or major EA organizations linked to that name. If this is a pseudonym or you can supply links or context, I can reassess."
