  "explanation": "As of my 2024-06 knowledge cutoff I cannot find a notable EA/rationalist figure named Constance Li \u2014 no prominent posts, talks, or citations on LessWrong, EA Forum, EA Global, Open Phil, 80,000 Hours, etc. Likewise there is no widely recognized public profile under that name. It may be a pseudonym or a private/obscure individual; try a current web/social-media search for more up-to-date information."
