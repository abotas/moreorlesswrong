  "explanation": "I cannot find a clearly identifiable EA/rationalist author known simply as 'Janika' \u2014 the name may be a pseudonym or ambiguous. There is no obvious public profile, publications, or talks linking a single notable figure by that name, so they appear unknown in EA circles and have no measurable global fame. If you have a last name, username, or a link, I can reassess."
