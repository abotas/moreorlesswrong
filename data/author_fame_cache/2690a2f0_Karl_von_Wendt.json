  "explanation": "I am not aware of a notable figure named Karl von Wendt in the EA/rationalist community or more broadly. There are no well-known publications, talks, or citations tied to this name in major EA/rationalist outlets, and the name appears to be either a pseudonym or an extremely obscure/low-profile author with no public prominence."
