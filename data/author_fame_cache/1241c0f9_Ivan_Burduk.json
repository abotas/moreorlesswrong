  "explanation": "I could not find evidence that Ivan Burduk is a known figure in the EA/rationalist community or a publicly recognized author. No notable posts on core EA/rationalist platforms (e.g., LessWrong, Effective Altruism Forum, 80,000 Hours), no widely cited academic or popular publications, and no clear public profile. Possibly a pseudonym or a very obscure/private author \u2014 provide links or context if you want a deeper check."
