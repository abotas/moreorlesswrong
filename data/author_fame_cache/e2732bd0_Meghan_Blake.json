  "explanation": "I do not recognize Meghan Blake as a known figure in the EA/rationalist community (no notable posts on EA forums, LessWrong, or EA-affiliated publications up to my 2024 cutoff). Outside EA there may be people named Meghan Blake who are authors/journalists with minor online presence, but no widely known public profile. If you can provide a link or more context (books, articles, handles), I can reassess more precisely."
