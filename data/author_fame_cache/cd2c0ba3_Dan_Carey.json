  "explanation": "The name Dan Carey is common and I find no clear evidence of a well-known author by that name in the EA/rationalist community; not recognized as a regular or prominent EA figure. Globally the name is not uniquely associated with a widely famous public intellectual (there are unrelated people with that name in music and other fields), so overall public prominence appears low. If you mean a specific Dan Carey (e.g., a music producer or another field), provide more context and I can reassess."
