  "explanation": "I can\u2019t find evidence that a writer known as \u201cYarrow\ud83d\udd38\u201d is a recognized figure in the EA/rationalist scene or more widely. The handle appears to be a pseudonym with little or no visible public footprint, citations, or appearances at major community venues, so they appear unknown both within EA and globally."
