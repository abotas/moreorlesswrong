  "explanation": "I find no identifiable presence for 'Kayode Adekoya' as a notable figure in the Effective Altruism/rationalist communities or as a publicly known author. The name appears common and could be a pseudonym; there are no obvious widely cited publications, talks, or media profiles under this name. If you have links or specific works, I can reassess."
