  "explanation": "I do not recognize a notable EA/rationalist author named 'Aditya Raj' (as of my 2024-06 knowledge). The name is common and ambiguous, with no clearly identified central figure, major EA publications, or widespread public profile tied to that name. If you can provide links or more context (books, essays, platform), I can reassess."
