  "explanation": "As of my knowledge cutoff (2024-06) Michael St Jules (with or without the \ud83d\udd38 emoji) is not a well-known figure in the EA/rationalist community \u2014 I find no evidence of high-profile roles, widely-cited EA writing, or frequent speaking. He may be an occasional or pseudonymous forum contributor, but has minimal public footprint and no notable global fame."
