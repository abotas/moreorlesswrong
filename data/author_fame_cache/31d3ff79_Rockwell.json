  "explanation": "I cannot find a clearly identifiable EA/rationalist author going by just 'Rockwell' (may be a pseudonym). There are no obvious publications, talks, or community profiles tying that name to a known figure in EA or to broader public prominence. Provide links or more context and I can reassess."
