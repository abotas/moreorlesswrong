  "explanation": "Jeff Kaufman appears to be a known contributor within EA/rationalist spaces (occasional/regular posts and discussions on community forums), so somewhat known to people who follow those forums but not a leading or highly prominent EA figure. Globally he has very low public recognition. Identification is uncertain and may be a pseudonym."
