    "explanation": "This is a moderately important question for the EA/rationalist community because it touches on longtermist decision theory, infinite ethics, and how to handle Pascalian/infinite expected-value-type problems \u2014 topics that can shape high-level cause prioritization and moral theory. However, the post is primarily a conceptual question rather than a novel argument or solution; practical decisions rarely hinge on precise methods for comparing infinities because such scenarios are highly uncertain and often handled by existing heuristics (probability weighting, lexical priorities, measure-selection). For general humanity the issue is largely academic and has minimal immediate practical impact."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Define your terms and pick a decision-theoretic / population-ethics framework before weighing factors. Actionable change: add a short, explicit definition of \u201cinfinite problem\u201d (e.g., \u201can event that causes nonzero harm to an infinite set of observers according to some observer measure\u201d) and state which aggregation rule you\u2019re using (total utilitarianism, average utilitarianism, critical-level, etc.). If you want to stay agnostic, present 2\u20133 alternative frameworks and show how they produce different rankings. Recommended reading to cite/use: Parfit (population ethics, Reasons and Persons), work on population ethics and total vs average utilitarianism, and standard discussions of decision theory with infinite/huge utilities (Pascal\u2019s-mugging literature). This is the foundational ambiguity that makes your list of factors unusable as-is.\n\n2) Treat measure, causal reach, and cosmological assumptions explicitly. Big mistake: assuming \u201cinfinite people harmed\u201d is a coherent probability without specifying how you\u2019re measuring people or what causal model allows an intervention to affect infinity (infinite spatial extent vs. infinite copies, Boltzmann brains, causal horizons). Actionable change: add a short section enumerating the key background assumptions required for a genuinely infinite problem (e.g., infinite spatially homogeneous universe, interventions can causally influence arbitrarily distant regions, identity/duplication assumptions), and say how your probability estimates would change under different assumptions. This lets readers see whether your question even applies to scenarios they care about.\n\n3) Give a concrete method for combining factors and handling infinities (regularization/robustness tests). Right now you list factors but don\u2019t show how to aggregate them; mathematically, P(infinite) \u00d7 infinite harm is undefined/unhelpful without regularization. Actionable change: (a) demonstrate at least one toy model \u2014 start from finite worlds and take limits, or compare per-capita harm vs total-harm approaches; (b) explain/choose a regularization strategy (e.g., per-capita weighting, spatial measure, cutoff and limit, bounded utilities, discounting, or refusing to assign nonzero probability to paradoxical infinities); (c) run a short sensitivity/robustness analysis showing whether your priority ordering changes under plausible regularization choices. This will prevent obvious \u201cown goals\u201d where you claim an infinite expected value but have not justified the formal steps that create it.",
    "improvement_potential": "Very high. The feedback identifies the core, potentially embarrassing gaps: no definitions/ethical framework, no account of how an intervention can affect an actual infinity, and no method for aggregating probabilities with infinite harms. These are exactly the issues that would make the author's factors unusable or lead to paradoxical claims of infinite expected value. The suggested fixes are concrete (define terms, state aggregation rule(s), enumerate cosmological/measure assumptions, give a regularization/toy-model) and point to relevant literature; they can be implemented succinctly and would greatly strengthen the post."

    "clarity_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The post is short, focused and the core question is easy to follow: how to compare/priority problems that could be infinite in scale. Strengths: clear structure (statement, motivating example, candidate factors) and a direct request for guidance. Weaknesses: key terms are underspecified (what exactly counts as an \"infinite problem\" or how to formalize \"how people are affected\"), the proposed factors are not operationalized, and the post lacks examples or references to relevant frameworks (measure theory, expected value with infinite populations, anthropic considerations) that would help readers give concrete advice."

    "explanation": "Among EA and related communities this topic is familiar: philosophers and EA writers have long discussed infinite ethics, Pascal\u2019s mugging, infinite expected value problems, countably infinite populations, and how to weight low\u2011probability huge outcomes. The post\u2019s idea of combining a probability that a problem is infinite with standard cause\u2011prioritization factors (neglect, solvability, spillovers) is sensible but not a very new move for that audience. For the general educated public, however, explicitly framing decision\u2011making/prioritization for genuinely infinite problems is moderately novel \u2014 most people haven\u2019t thought through applying neglect/solvability/expected\u2011value thinking to infinities even though the underlying issues appear in philosophy and popular discussion."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post raises a legitimate and interesting problem, identifies several relevant factors (probability of infinite scale, how people are affected, neglect, solvability, spillovers), and honestly notes uncertainty. Weaknesses: The argument is underspecified and lacks formal definitions (what \"infinite\" means here, how to compare infinities), no engagement with relevant philosophical/mathematical literature (infinite ethics, measure theory, cosmology, decision theory), and no concrete method for applying or weighting the suggested factors. There is no empirical evidence provided. Overall, the idea is plausible and worth exploring, but the post offers only preliminary, informal reasoning and no supporting evidence, so the claim is weakly supported."

    "validation_notes": "Mixed / uncertain. The post\u2019s core claim is conditional (\"if the universe is infinite, ...\") and is logically coherent, but rests on empirical premises that are unresolved. Observations (Planck CMB + BAO etc.) are consistent with a spatially flat universe \u2014 which could be spatially infinite \u2014 but they do not prove spatial infinitude and global topology could still make the universe finite. Even given spatial infinitude, whether there are truly infinitely many value\u2011bearing beings (or \u2018\u2018solvable evils\u2019\u2019 that affect infinitely many people) depends on further physical and distributional assumptions; philosophers and cosmologists treat these as open problems (the measure/anthropic problems and population\u2011ethics paradoxes). Thus the post\u2019s suggestion that infinite problems may exist is plausible as a conditional hypothesis but not empirically established, and comparing such problems requires engaging known technical issues (cosmological curvature/topology limits, measure/anthropic reasoning, and population\u2011ethics paradoxes).",
