    "explanation": "I could not find evidence that 'Aaron Boddy\ud83d\udd38' is a known figure in the EA/rationalist community or more broadly (no prominent posts on EA Forum/LessWrong, no widely cited publications, books, or public talks up to my 2024-06 knowledge cutoff). May be a pseudonym or a minor/very new online presence. If you can share links or contexts (forum profile, articles), I can reassess."
