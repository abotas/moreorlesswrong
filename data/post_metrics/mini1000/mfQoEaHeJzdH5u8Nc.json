    "explanation": "This post is practically useful for the EA community: it aggregates survey evidence and plausible mechanisms suggesting EA involvement is neutral-to-positive for many people's mental health, highlights caveats (selection bias, lack of causal evidence), and points to resources and areas for improvement. That makes it moderately important for community policy, retention, wellbeing initiatives, and norms, but it is not foundational to EA's core epistemic or strategic claims. For general humanity the piece has limited relevance beyond being an illustrative case about how values-driven communities can affect wellbeing, so its broader impact is minor."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Stronger caveat on the central claim and declare conflicts of interest. The post\u2019s headline conclusion (\u201clightly points toward EA being good or neutral\u2026\u201d) is stronger than the evidence justifies. The surveys are self\u2011selected, cross\u2011sectional, and subject to social\u2011desirability and survivorship biases (you note some of these but don\u2019t make the resulting uncertainty explicit). Revise the framing to avoid implying causal evidence \u2014 e.g. \u201cMost available self\u2011report surveys suggest many respondents perceive EA as neutral or positive for their wellbeing, but this is not evidence that EA causes better mental health.\u201d Also explicitly state the authors\u2019 CEA affiliation near the top as a potential source of perceived bias.  \n\n2) Major gaps in the data and concrete fixes you could recommend. The post doesn\u2019t offer practical ways to address the biggest empirical weaknesses (no baseline, no representative sample, no leavers\u2019 data). Recommend (and ideally commit to) specific study designs and metrics readers can evaluate: longitudinal cohorts that measure pre\u2011EA baseline and use validated scales (PHQ\u20119/GAD\u20117), targeted outreach to people who left EA (alumni/leavers surveys or social media recruitment), matched\u2011comparison groups (people with similar demographics/interests who didn\u2019t join EA), reporting effect sizes and confidence intervals, nonresponse weighting, and pre\u2011registration/independent analysis. If you can\u2019t run studies, call for them and suggest partner organizations (independent academics or Rethink Priorities).  \n\n3) Under\u2011emphasised heterogeneity and practical takeaways for at\u2011risk subgroups. The post treats EA as broadly homogeneous but glosses over plausible high\u2011risk groups (organisers, activists, people working on high\u2011stakes x\u2011risk topics, those with pre\u2011existing conditions). Add a short, explicit section identifying likely vulnerable subgroups, summarise any subgroup analyses (or state they\u2019re missing), and give concrete, low\u2011burden community actions (regular anonymous exit/intervention surveys, confidential support lines, organizer mental\u2011health checklists, targeted mentoring/check\u2011ins). This keeps the post actionable for readers without lengthening it much.",
    "improvement_potential": "Targets real, substantive weaknesses: the headline overstates causal inference, COI should be declared earlier, and the post omits practical fixes for the biggest empirical gaps and underplays subgroup risk. Implementing the suggestions would materially increase the post\u2019s credibility and usefulness without much extra length."

    "explanation": "The post is well-structured and easy to follow: clear headings, logical flow (evidence \u2192 possible mechanisms \u2192 caveats \u2192 resources), and balanced caveats about causation and selection bias. It presents its main point (EA tends to be neutral or positive for most respondents) clearly and supports it with links to surveys and analyses. Weaknesses: it relies on non-representative survey data without presenting key numbers, repeats a few points (minor redundancy), and the embedded image is not described for accessibility. It could be slightly more concise and tighter on the evidence discussion (e.g. include summary statistics) but is overall clear and compelling."

    "explanation": "For EA readers the claims and evidence are mostly familiar \u2014 community/purpose boosting wellbeing, known risks like impact\u2011obsession, and existing EA mental\u2011health surveys \u2014 so this is not very novel. The post\u2019s somewhat original contributions are the concise synthesis of EA\u2011specific survey results (EA Survey 2022 and earlier community surveys), the explicit note about lack of causal comparisons and selection bias, and the practical, balanced framing and resources. To a general audience the idea that participation in a values\u2011based community can be neutral/beneficial is plausible/common knowledge, though the EA\u2011specific survey evidence and community nuances make it moderately interesting."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post is logically organized, balanced, and appropriately cautious \u2014 it cites multiple surveys, offers plausible mechanisms for both positive and negative effects, and explicitly notes key limitations (selection bias, lack of causal comparisons). Weaknesses: The empirical basis is limited to self\u2011report, largely non\u2011representative and cross\u2011sectional surveys (with likely survivorship and social\u2011desirability biases), small-sample analyses, and no matched control or longitudinal causal evidence. That makes the conclusion \u2014 that EA is probably neutral/positive for most participants \u2014 plausible but only moderately supported."

    "validation_notes": "Most of the post's empirical claims are well-supported by available community surveys and by broader mental-health literature, with appropriate caveats noted in the post. Key points supported: (a) multiple EA-focused surveys exist (2019, 2021, 2022, 2023) and the EA Survey 2022 (largest/most representative EA dataset cited) reports more respondents saying EA increased their mental health (36.8%) than worsened it (16.4%), with ~36% unchanged \u2014 this supports the author's headline claim that evidence \u2018lightly points\u2019 to neutral/positive effects for many. (b) Earlier community surveys (2019) found more EA involvement correlated weakly/insignificantly with better mental health. (c) The author correctly highlights selection bias and the lack of causal, population-comparison studies \u2014 I found no published, representative causal/comparative study comparing EA mental-health rates to matched non-EA populations. (d) Theoretical mechanisms invoked (social connection / sense of purpose) are supported by systematic reviews/meta-analyses linking social connectedness and purpose to better mental health. Limitations: the EA mental-health evidence is mainly from non-random, self-selected, cross-sectional surveys (self-report), so causal claims are unsupported and effect sizes/representativeness are uncertain. Overall: the post accurately represents the available empirical evidence and its limits; rating = 8 (well-supported but not definitive).",
