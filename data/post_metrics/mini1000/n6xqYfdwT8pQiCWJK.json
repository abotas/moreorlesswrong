    "explanation": "This is a useful, concrete early-stage report on a potentially high-ROI global health intervention (reducing unmet need for contraception in Nigeria) with pilot data, transparent costing and a clear plan to scale and influence state policy. For the EA/rationalist community it\u2019s moderately important: if the cost\u2011effectiveness claims hold up, this is a donor\u2011relevant opportunity comparable to GiveWell\u2011style recommendations, and the operational lessons about supply chains and measurement are practically useful. It is not foundational to longtermist or existential-risk agendas and carries significant uncertainty (small pilot, pre\u2011post design, scaling risks), so it\u2019s not top\u2011tier importance. For general humanity it\u2019s of modest importance: meaningful local benefits (averted pregnancies, maternal deaths, improved agency) but limited in global scale and not transformative beyond standard development priorities."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Weak causal inference and limited external validity \u2014 the pilot is a pre/post study with a small number of deliveries and short follow-up, so short-term surges, Hawthorne effects, and substitution from the private sector could be driving most of the observed increases. Actionable fixes: (a) describe precisely how control LGAs were selected and show confidence intervals and facility-level heterogeneity; (b) run (or commit to run) a randomized or stepped-wedge rollout for Year 2 or at minimum longer follow-up so you can distinguish temporary spikes from sustained uptake; (c) measure and report private-market use (e.g. local pharmacy sales) and client-reported counterfactuals to quantify substitution; and (d) explicitly state the size of the discounts you applied for non-RCT design and why.\n\n2) Cost-effectiveness model lacks clarity on the key assumptions that drive headline metrics (lives saved, DALYs, CYP\u2192pregnancy\u2192mortality mapping). Readers will reasonably treat your $/CYP and $/life numbers as very sensitive to a few parameters. Actionable fixes: (a) include (or link prominently to) a short table of the handful of parameters that most affect results (baseline MMR used, probability an averted pregnancy prevents a maternal death, CYP\u2192unintended pregnancies mapping, private-market displacement rate, discount factors), with best/central/worst-case values; (b) publish tornado/sensitivity analyses showing how your $/life and $/DALY change; and (c) reconcile differences with GiveWell\u2019s contraception model (you note you will do this \u2014 please summarise the biggest model differences up front so donors can interpret your claims).\n\n3) Operational and ethical risks around scale-up are understated (provider capacity for implant insertion and follow-up, informed consent/agency, leakage/resale, and the political risk of government crowd-out). Actionable fixes: (a) add a brief section listing the main operational failure modes and your mitigation plans \u2014 e.g. training and supervision budget and metrics for insertion quality/complications, informed-consent safeguards and how you will monitor coercion/partner pressure, concrete plan for RFID/mystery-client piloting and its limits, and contingency if states do not adopt procurement legislation; (b) show the budget line items and unit costs for training and quality assurance (so donors can see you budgeted for safe service delivery); and (c) clarify how you will ensure method mix and women\u2019s choice (not just prioritising Implanon for cost reasons) and how that choice is reflected in your impact model.\n\nAddressing these three areas will substantially strengthen credibility for both technical reviewers and prospective donors without making the post much longer \u2014 each can be done with short additions (a paragraph or two plus a sensitivity table/link).",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback targets the post\u2019s biggest potential own-goals: overstating causal impact from a small pre/post pilot, presenting headline cost\u2011effectiveness without transparent key assumptions or sensitivity analysis, and underplaying operational/ethical risks of scaling (coercion, poor-quality implant insertions, leakage). Each point is specific and actionable (show CIs/facility heterogeneity, pre-register or run randomized/stepped rollout or longer follow-up, publish key parameters and tornado analyses, add mitigation/budget lines for trainings/RFID/mystery clients and consent monitoring). Implementing these fixes would substantially increase credibility for technical reviewers and donors without greatly lengthening the post. The feedback could be slightly improved by adding suggestions to share anonymised facility\u2011level data, pre-specify analysis plans/power calculations, and list the exact discount amounts already applied."

    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "Well-structured and generally easy to follow: strong headings, a concise TL;DR, clear progression (problem \u2192 pilot \u2192 results \u2192 Year 2 \u2192 budget), and useful links to data and models. Key terms (CYP, DALY) are defined and numerical results are prominent. Weaknesses: the post is long and sometimes dense (especially the cost-effectiveness section), relies heavily on external spreadsheets for crucial assumptions, and uses some technical jargon and modelling claims that would benefit from a short, in-text summary of key assumptions. Trimming repeated material and briefly summarising the main modelling assumptions/uncertainties in-line would make it even clearer."

    "explanation": "Among EA readers the core ideas (family planning as high-impact intervention, measuring CYPs, addressing stockouts, cost\u2011effectiveness modelling, and pushing government procurement) are well\u2011trodden territory \u2014 so the post is only mildly novel. A few operational details (low\u2011cost RFID tagging, focus on Implanon procurement as the main lever, the particular Nigerian state\u2011procurement advocacy pathway, and some pilot measurement techniques) add some originality but are incremental. For the general public the combination of supply\u2011chain diagnostics, targeted procurement, and policy work to fix contraceptive access is moderately novel and concrete \u2014 more detail than most people have considered, but not a radical or previously unimagined idea."

    "overall_support": 5,
    "explanation": "Strengths: The post presents a clear, plausible theory of change (increase supply \u2192 increase uptake \u2192 avert pregnancies/maternal harm), documents a reasonable pilot design with data triangulation (facility registers, stock counts, M&E visits), uses control regions for pre-post comparison, is transparent about spending and publishes models/spreadsheets, and explicitly acknowledges uncertainties and plans to incorporate GiveWell/Govt partners. Weaknesses: The empirical evidence is preliminary and limited \u2014 the pilot covered 137 facilities with only three supplemental deliveries (non-randomised with pre-post comparisons), short follow-up, and potential confounders (Hawthorne effects, shifts from private to public, skipped deliveries upstream) that make causal attribution uncertain. Cost\u2011effectiveness estimates rely on many modeling assumptions and discounts that are not fully detailed in the post (and are sensitive to generalisation). Overall, the arguments are logically structured and candid about limits, but the current empirical base is modest, so conclusions about large-scale cost\u2011effectiveness remain tentative and require larger, longer, and more rigorous evaluation (ideally randomized or staggered rollouts and better leakage measurement)."

    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 6,
    "validation_notes": "Mixed accuracy. Major load-bearing epidemiological claims are mostly supported: Nigeria\u2019s extremely high maternal mortality burden (MMR \u22481,000/100,000 for 2020 and Nigeria accounting for ~28.5% of global maternal deaths in 2020) is documented by UN/WHO estimates. Stockouts and supply\u2011chain problems for contraceptives in LMICs (and Nigeria specifically) are well documented. GiveWell\u2019s contraception valuation and the GiveWell benchmark (~<$20 per CYP) are correctly cited. However, some important empirical claims are inaccurate or unverifiable from public sources: the statement that \u201c6 out of 10 women of reproductive age in Nigeria have an unmet need for contraception\u201d is not supported by national survey data (NDHS/other sources show unmet\u2011need around ~14\u201320% among married women, not ~60%); the posted \u201c29% unintended pregnancies\u201d is higher than the Guttmacher/Nigeria \u2018Adding It Up\u2019 figures (~24% in published analyses); the exact \u201c78% of the time\u201d stockout figure and several pilot effect sizes/cost numbers are internal to AMI and cannot be externally verified (and AMI later published updated pilot results with different point estimates). Overall: the post contains several well-supported contextual facts and plausible modelling done by the authors, but it also contains at least one clear factual overstatement (unmet\u2011need) and some internal pilot claims that should be treated as provisional until raw data or peer\u2011reviewed analysis are available.",
