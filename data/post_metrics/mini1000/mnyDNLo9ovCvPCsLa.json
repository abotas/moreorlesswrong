    "explanation": "I can find no evidence that a \"Dave Cortright \ud83d\udd38\" is a known figure in the EA/rationalist community\u2014no high\u2011visibility posts, talks, or widely cited writings. The handle may be a pseudonym or minor online user. (There is an unrelated academic David Cortright in peace/arms\u2011control circles, but he is not prominent within EA.)"
