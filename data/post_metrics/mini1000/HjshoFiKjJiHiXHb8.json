    "explanation": "This question is moderately important to the EA/rationalist community because it touches on marginal impact, additionality, and how to structure donations to be decisive \u2014 practical issues that affect allocation choices and donor behavior. It is not foundational to EA or longtermist theory, and answers are largely operational (matching grants, funding gaps, early-stage orgs, conditional/earmarked gifts) rather than paradigm-shifting, so its overall load-bearing value is medium. For general humanity it is low importance: the question is about a niche donor strategy and would not materially change large-scale outcomes or public policy even if answered definitively."

    "explanation": "The main question is understandable: the author wants donations that are likely to be decisive in saving an individual human or animal and gives a concrete example (Against Malaria Foundation). Strengths: clear motivation, concrete donation-size constraint, and a relevant example. Weaknesses: the post is somewhat rambling and repetitive, mixes human and animal targets without clearly separating them, uses informal phrasing and unclear terms (e.g. what exactly is meant by \u201ccertain\u201d), and includes tangential material (video link, study citation) without integrating it. Clarifying key definitions, separating goals (humans vs animals), and tightening structure would make it much clearer."

    "explanation": "Among EA Forum readers the core ideas (marginal impact of donations, counterfactual impact, AMF-style follow-ups, cost\u2011effectiveness comparisons, and consumer\u2011boycott effects on animal numbers) are well known and widely discussed, so this is only slightly novel (score ~3). For the general educated public, the post\u2019s focus on wanting a donation that is causally decisive (and the specific contrast with voting, plus the animal\u2011breeding/consumer boycott angle) is less commonly considered and moderately novel (~6)."

    "overall_support": 3,
    "explanation": "The post raises a clear, practical question and gives a useful real-world example (AMF notifying donors), but its reasoning is shallow and sometimes confused. It treats 'making a difference' as a binary, high\u2011certainty outcome rather than a probabilistic/counterfactual question, overlooks standard EA frameworks (counterfactual impact, marginal dollars, expected value, fungibility), and doesn't consider how charities respond to incremental donations or how to get high-leverage opportunities (matching, conditional grants, advocacy). The empirical support is weak: one anecdotal example (AMF) and an unexamined video/study claim about chickens are insufficient to generalize; there are no citations to GiveWell/Open Phil or to literature estimating marginal lives saved per dollar, displacement effects, or field trials. To be stronger the post would need clearer framing (counterfactual impact), engagement with existing evidence and evaluators, and concrete data on cost-effectiveness or mechanisms that make a donation decisive."

    "validation_notes": "Mixed / uncertain. Key factual claim about the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) providing donors with allocation information and post\u2011distribution monitoring is well supported \u2014 AMF links individual donations to specific distributions and publishes PDM results. Claims that a small (~<$5k) donation \u201cwill make no difference\u201d are too general: marginal impact depends on the charity and funding opportunities (GiveWell/charity evaluators explicitly distinguish average vs. marginal impact). The claim that an individual consumer has a \u201c90\u2011something percent\u201d chance of causing \u201c1\u2013900\u201d extra chickens to be bred is a mischaracterization: the 1-in-900 / ~900\u2011bird threshold figure appears as a back\u2011of\u2011the\u2011envelope / threshold thought\u2011experiment in philosophy literature (citing industry scale data), not a controlled empirical study; it relies on multiple strong assumptions about producers\u2019 thresholds and responses. Overall: parts of the post are accurate and verifiable (AMF transparency; literature debating whether single consumers matter), but the numerical chicken \u201c90% chance\u201d claim is not an established empirical result and the blanket claim that <$5k donations \u201cwon\u2019t make a difference\u201d is context-dependent and therefore not generally verifiable.",

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Define what \u201cmaking a difference\u201d means and use counterfactual reasoning. Right now the post treats \u201cdifference\u201d as a single, obvious thing (one extra human/animal saved) but never defines the metric (life saved, death averted, suffering reduced, QALY/DALY). It also asks for certainty rather than expected impact. Revise the post to (a) pick a clear outcome metric and time horizon, and (b) explain you want high probability of a non\u2011zero marginal effect (or ask for highest expected impact per dollar). This will stop readers from being confused about what counts as success and make answers actionable. \n\n2) Deal with fungibility and marginal funding explicitly \u2014 don\u2019t assume small donations can or can\u2019t be decisive. The key empirical question is whether your $\u2264$5k is marginal for the charity you\u2019d fund (i.e., would it fund an otherwise-unfunded intervention). Before publishing, add a short section saying you\u2019ll look for charities with explicit \u201croom for more funding\u201d / projectized campaigns or that will tell you how marginal dollars are used. Actionable steps to suggest to readers: contact charities and ask \u201cIf I gave $X today, what exactly would that fund, and would those activities not happen without my gift?\u201d; prefer orgs that run discrete, traceable interventions (e.g., AMF bednets, particular surgical campaigns, or sponsored rescue operations). Also link to GiveWell/Animal Charity Evaluators guidance on marginal impact/room for more funding so readers can follow up. \n\n3) Don\u2019t conflate mechanisms (consumer choices vs donations) or rely on a single YouTube example. The post treats a consumer\u2011boycott study as if it were the same kind of evidence you could expect for donations; those are different causal pathways and different evidentiary standards. Either remove the lone video citation or replace it with peer\u2011reviewed work and clarify the distinction: consumer purchase decisions change company production; donations typically change organizational activity and are subject to crowding\u2011out and redirecting. For animal causes, explicitly suggest consulting ACE and asking animal orgs whether $5k would fund a discrete corporate engagement/campaign or be absorbed into general funds \u2014 those are the situations most likely to yield a traceable, decisive outcome. \n\nImplementing these three changes will make the post clearer, reduce obvious misunderstandings, and produce answers that actually help readers choose donations likely to be marginally effective.",
    "improvement_potential": "Targets the post's major mistakes: undefined outcome metric and counterfactual reasoning, ignoring fungibility/room-for-more-funding, and conflating consumer\u2011action vs donation causal pathways. Gives concrete, actionable fixes (pick metric/time horizon, ask charities how marginal dollars are used, prefer discrete interventions, cite GiveWell/ACE) that would substantially improve clarity and answerability with minimal extra length. Not a 10 because it doesn't demonstrate the author's whole thesis is false\u2014rather it corrects foundational confusions that would otherwise produce bad answers."
