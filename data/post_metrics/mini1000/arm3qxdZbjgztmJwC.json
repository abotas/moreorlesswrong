    "explanation": "This is a practical outreach/solicitation post offering MEL (monitoring, evaluation, learning) and Theory-of-Change support to EA orgs. For the EA community it has modest importance: if the service is high-quality and adopted it could improve planning and impact measurement at some organisations, helping them make better decisions and allocation of resources, but it is not foundational to EA theory or large-scale strategy. For general humanity it is essentially irrelevant \u2014 it affects a narrow operational niche and has no broad societal implications unless it scaled dramatically."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Be explicit about what you\u2019re offering and what you want from people. Right now readers don\u2019t know the scope, typical timeline, or expected cost of the MEL/ToC support (and the \u201cFill out the form\u201d link isn\u2019t visible in the post text). Add a one\u2011paragraph summary (1\u20132 sentences) of typical deliverables, an estimated duration and cost model (paid / pro bono / sliding scale), and what information the form collects and how long it takes. This reduces friction and avoids irrelevant signups.\n\n2) Add clear data/privacy and consent language. You say you\u2019ll \u201cuse the list\u201d to show demand to funders \u2014 say exactly what that means: who will see individual responses, whether you\u2019ll share organization names with funders or only anonymized counts, whether respondents will be contacted, and how long you\u2019ll keep the data. Add an opt\u2011in checkbox for being on a contact/waitlist and an option to keep responses confidential or anonymous. This is important for trust and for compliance with organizational policies.\n\n3) Define prioritisation and urgency criteria. You currently say you\u2019ll prioritise paid projects and \u201chigh\u2011priority\u201d cases but don\u2019t define either. Provide brief, concrete selection criteria (e.g., evidence of impact scale, time\u2011sensitivity, lack of existing MEL capacity, ability to pay) and a short timeline for follow\u2011up (e.g., when the waiting list will be reviewed and how decisions will be communicated). That will reduce perceptions of bias and help organisations self\u2011select appropriately.\n\nSuggested small edits you can paste in: a) a one\u2011line service description at the top, b) a 1\u20132 sentence data\u2011use/consent blurb before the form link, and c) a short bullet list of the prioritisation criteria and what \u201curgent\u201d means. Making these three changes should materially increase useful responses and reduce confusion or pushback.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback pinpoints several concrete, high-impact omissions (unclear scope/timeline/cost, missing data\u2011use/consent details, and vague prioritisation) that are likely to cause irrelevant signups, trust issues, or perceived bias. These are not fatal to the post but are important, fixable \u2018own goals\u2019 the authors would likely be embarrassed about once pointed out. The suggested fixes are short and practical, so implementing them should materially improve response quality without bloating the post."

    "explanation": "Clear, direct call-to-action with useful links, contact details, and a concise explanation of purpose (building a waiting list and refining services). Weaknesses are minor: a few typos/awkward phrasings, some jargon (MEL/ToC) that isn\u2019t defined for newcomers, and missing specifics (no deadline/year for funding mention, no brief description of what the form asks or what counts as 'urgent'). Overall easy to understand and appropriately concise."

    "explanation": "This is largely a routine outreach/posting: offering MEL/ToC services, asking interested organizations to fill a form, building a waitlist, and offering limited pro bono work are all very common practices within EA and nonprofit communities. Within the EA Forum audience this is not novel at all (many consultancies, capacity\u2011building offers, and intake/waitlist posts exist). For the general public it\u2019s slightly more specific because MEL/ToC and targeted EA support are specialized concepts, but the overall idea (service solicitation and client intake) remains familiar."

    "explanation": "This post is primarily an outreach/ask rather than a sustained argumentative claim, so its reasoning is simple and generally coherent: they collected prior positive feedback, want to gather demand, and offer limited pro bono capacity. That makes the logical structure fine but minimal. However, empirical support is weak \u2014 the post asserts \"a lot of positive, encouraging feedback\" and claims demand without providing data, examples, or credentials (no testimonials, numbers, or past project outcomes). Overall the main thrust (build a waiting list / solicit interest) is reasonable and appropriate for the forum, but the post provides little evidence to substantiate broader claims about demand or impact, limiting how well-supported it is beyond being a plausible call-to-action."

    "validation_notes": "Most of the post's empirical claims are verifiable and supported. I found the earlier EA Forum post (Feb 13, 2025) by the same team announcing Salt & Impact, which explicitly states they had ~three months of runway (consistent with 'funding runs out in April'), offered five free workshops / one ToC process, and solicited feedback \u2014 and that post received multiple positive answers and upvotes (supporting the 'positive, encouraging feedback' claim). Community-roundup posts (EA Organization Updates) also record Salt Impact gauging interest and offering limited pro-bono slots. I could not find a separate EA Forum post matching the exact title & author string you quoted (Clara Jule Roberts) for the follow-up form post, but multiple independent sources confirm the team, their outreach to EA orgs, and limited pro-bono capacity. Minor uncertainty remains about the exact authorship/URL of the specific follow-up post and the precise current status of funding after April 2025 (the cited runway statement was time-limited).",
