    "explanation": "This is a useful literature summary for people doing cost\u2011effectiveness, policy, or priority\u2011setting in global health and EA (it affects how we convert health gains into monetary terms and could change funding/prioritization). It's not foundational to most EA/longtermist arguments, so its truth would mainly influence health\u2011economics decisions rather than the whole movement. For the general public it has modest impact \u2014 relevant to policymakers but not broadly critical."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Treat the methodological limitations of stated-preference work as central, not peripheral. Stated WTP for a QALY is highly sensitive to hypothetical bias, framing/anchoring, scope insensitivity, payment vehicle, time discounting, and sample selection. The post should explicitly list these biases, say how each likely biases estimates (direction and magnitude where possible), and cite validation studies that compare stated preferences to revealed-behaviour estimates. Actionable fix: add a short subsection titled \u201cKey measurement problems\u201d with 4\u20136 bullet points and at least 2\u20133 references, and present your headline numbers as ranges/sensitivity scenarios rather than single-point estimates. \n\n2) Be explicit about conceptual and policy distinctions you\u2019re using. Many readers conflate WTP per QALY, value of a statistical life (VSL), and value of a life-year (VSLY), and mix quality-improvements with life-extension. You should (a) define QALY vs VSL vs VSLY, (b) explain whether the studies you review value marginal QALYs or average life-years, (c) flag normative issues (income effects and equity \u2014 WTP reflects ability to pay), and (d) give clear guidance on how a policymaker should use stated-preference estimates (when they are appropriate, when VSL is better, how to adjust for income/currency/age). Actionable fix: add a short \u201cDefinitions and policy use\u201d box and one concrete example showing how to convert an observed WTP into a policy-relevant threshold. \n\n3) Don\u2019t present a single \u201cvalue\u201d without addressing heterogeneity and external validity. WTP per QALY varies greatly by income, age, baseline health, risk framing (own life vs others), and country. Overlooking this is an own goal because it\u2019ll mislead readers about applicability. Actionable fix: report central tendency plus interquartile range and at least one subgroup breakdown (income or country). If you don\u2019t have space, explicitly flag that numbers are context-dependent and give guidance on which contexts your summary applies to (e.g., high-income general-population surveys vs low-income or patient samples).",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback hits the key risks: methodological biases in stated-preference WTP, conceptual confusion between QALY/VSL/VSLY, and neglecting heterogeneity/external validity. These are central issues that would materially mislead readers if not addressed and the suggestions are concrete and actionable (bullet lists, ranges, subgroup breakdowns). It isn\u2019t a fatal critique that makes the whole thesis wrong, but fixing these points would substantially raise credibility and utility; it will add some length, so prioritisation of the most important biases/references would be helpful."

    "explanation": "Clear and easy to follow for an EA/health-policy audience: it states the topic (stated preferences for health-income trade-offs), why it matters, and that more posts are coming. Strengths: concise, purposeful, includes a call for topic requests. Weaknesses: very short and more of a teaser than a substantive summary \u2014 it uses the term 'QALY' without definition and gives no indication of key findings or methods, so a reader unfamiliar with the topic might want a bit more detail or a link."

    "explanation": "For an EA Forum audience this is not very novel: valuing QALYs and stated-preference literature are well known to health-economics and longtermist readers, and the point that responses vary by context is a standard caveat. For the general public it's moderately novel \u2014 many laypeople haven't encountered QALY valuation or health-income trade-off studies in depth \u2014 but the post is mainly a literature summary rather than presenting new concepts or claims."

    "overall_support": 2,
    "explanation": "The post makes a plausible high-level claim (that literature on stated health-income trade-offs matters because responses vary and could bias valuations) but gives almost no argumentation or detail \u2014 no theoretical framing, no description of which variations matter, nor discussion of methodological issues. Empirical evidence is effectively absent: the author says they \"wrote about the literature\" but provides no citations, results, sample/method details, or robustness checks. Strength: topic is important and the central point is plausible. Weaknesses: lack of presented data, methods, references, and explicit logical development, so the claim is only weakly supported."

    "validation_notes": "Well supported. Multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses show a substantial empirical literature estimating willingness-to-pay (WTP) per QALY, large heterogeneity across studies (by income, age, health gain type \u2014 life extension vs QoL \u2014 survey mode, payment vehicle, etc.), and policy relevance (WTP estimates are used to discuss cost\u2011effectiveness thresholds). Key quantitative findings (e.g., mean/median WTP per QALY estimates, correlations with income/GDP per capita, and effects of age/mode) match the post\u2019s claims. Limitations: stated\u2011preference (contingent valuation / DCE) methods suffer from hypothetical bias and methodological heterogeneity, so individual WTP estimates can be biased and vary widely; there is an active policy debate whether WTP or opportunity\u2011cost (health forgone) approaches should set thresholds. Overall the post\u2019s empirical claims are accurate but should be read with the methodological caveats above.",
