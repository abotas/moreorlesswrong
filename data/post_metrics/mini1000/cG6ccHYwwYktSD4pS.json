    "explanation": "For the EA/rationalist community this is moderately-to-highly important: it directly bears on philanthropic priorities and marginal funding choices (potentially justifying large shifts toward wild/farmed-animal interventions) and therefore could change where EA resources flow. However, the paper depends on many controversial and highly uncertain mappings (animal-years \u2192 DALYs, welfare-range priors, sentience assumptions for arthropods, choice of reference spend categories), so its conclusions are not yet foundational or robust enough to overturn core EA consensus without substantial follow-up work. For general humanity the post is of low importance: even if the magnitudes are correct, it is unlikely to immediately change public policy or mass behavior, and relies on ethical/value assumptions that the general public mostly does not act on today."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) You\u2019re using poor proxies for \u201cspending on X\u201d (an input that strongly drives your neglect conclusions). Treating global military spending as the money spent to reduce harms from conflicts (and treating total climate finance as money spent to reduce harms from global warming) is misleading because much of that spending does not aim to reduce human/animal suffering and can even increase it. Actionable fix: replace these proxies with spending on conflict prevention/peacebuilding and humanitarian aid (OECD CRS, OCHA appeals, SIPRI/peacebuilding budgets), or \u2014 better \u2014 avoid area-level spending entirely and base neglect claims on marginal cost-effectiveness estimates for representative interventions/organisations. At minimum add a caveat and a sensitivity analysis showing how results change if you use conflict-prevention/humanitarian spending instead of total military spending.  \n\n2) You collapse extreme uncertainty about wild-animal welfare and arthropod populations into single-point estimates and then present implausibly precise results (e.g. \u201c0.0576 s\u201d). Two linked problems: (a) the welfare-per-individual-year for wild arthropods is profoundly uncertain (you pick 1 or 3e-4 DALYs with limited justification); (b) global arthropod population sizes and how to convert RP welfare ranges into DALYs are also highly uncertain. Actionable fix: present multiple scenarios (e.g. neutral, moderately negative, and strongly negative insects) and a wide sensitivity range for population and welfare-per-year parameters; show break-even analyses (what welfare-per-insect or what population would flip your conclusions); replace point-precision with ranges/credible intervals and tone down absolute wording (avoid \u201csuper neglected\u201d unless robust across plausible scenarios).  \n\n3) You conflate different units and moral assumptions without justification (human DALYs vs RP welfare ranges converted to DALY-like units). The mapping from RP\u2019s \u2018welfare ranges\u2019 to DALYs and the aggregation of human DALYs with animal \u201cDALY-equivalents\u201d needs clearer justification because it\u2019s the backbone of your comparisons. Actionable fix: explicitly document and justify the conversion method (show equations, assumptions, and any normative choices), or drop the cross-domain DALY-comparison and instead compare cost-effectiveness on the margin using concrete org-level metrics (DALYs or QALYs averted per $ for humans; welfare-range\u2013adjusted animal-years per $ for animals). If you keep the current approach, add robustness checks showing how sensitive your ranking of areas/organisations is to alternative, plausible conversion methods.",
    "improvement_potential": "Addresses central, high\u2011impact methodological flaws. The three points identify major mistakes that could materially change the paper\u2019s neglect rankings: using total military/climate spending as proxies for spending to reduce harms, collapsing extreme uncertainty in wild\u2011animal parameters into point estimates, and conflating different normative units without documenting conversions. Fixing these (better spending proxies or org\u2011level marginal analyses; scenario/sensitivity and break\u2011even analyses for populations and welfare-per\u2011animal; explicit conversion equations and robustness checks) would substantially improve validity and credibility and likely change how emphatically the thesis can be stated."

    "explanation": "The post is well organized (clear Summary, Methods, Results, Discussion) and makes its central claim explicit with many data sources and a public spreadsheet, which helps verifiability. However it is dense and technical: many acronyms, heavy numerical conversions (DALYs \u2192 hours/seconds), and numerous implicit assumptions make it hard to follow without careful reading and domain knowledge. The Methods section is long and assumption-heavy, key figures/graphs are not described in text, and there is some repetition, so a reader needs effort to reconstruct the argument and judge its validity."

    "explanation": "Within the EA/Longevist/animal-welfare community the core claims (WAS >> farmed animals; both are highly neglected vs major human-focused causes; cost\u2011effectiveness arguments favour animal causes) are already familiar and have been discussed and modelled by groups like RP, WAI, and others. What is moderately novel for EA readers is the specific, detailed cross\u2011sector quantitative framing: converting DALYs to animal\u2011year equivalents, putting wild arthropods front-and-center, the particular parametric choices (e.g. shrimp/fish broiler multipliers), and the explicit spending vs welfare loss charts and hour/second equivalences. For the general public these ideas are much less familiar \u2014 the magnitude claim that wild animal suffering dwarfs climate, pandemics and conflict, plus the arthropod\u2011focused recommendations, are striking and likely new to most educated readers."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post is systematic and transparent (publishes spreadsheets, cites GBD, climate projections, spending sources) and sets out a clear, reproducible method for comparing \u2018\u2018welfare loss\u2019\u2019 and spending across domains. The author explicitly lists assumptions and links to prior work, and attempts to normalize across areas (DALYs, animal welfare ranges). Weaknesses: Many core steps rely on highly uncertain, contested, or conceptually fraught conversions (e.g., mapping animal welfare ranges to DALYs, treating wild arthropods as the dominant source of suffering, and using point estimates rather than uncertainty ranges). Some spending proxies are misleading (military spending used as \u2018\u2018spending to improve conflicts\u2019\u2019; climate finance/death projections are from different years/time horizons than other estimates). Key inputs (animal population sizes, per\u2011animal welfare losses, cost\u2011effectiveness multipliers like SWP = 64k\u00d7 GiveWell) are speculative and lack robust empirical support or sensitivity analysis. As a result, the qualitative conclusion that wild animal suffering is neglected may be plausible, but the quantitative magnitudes and rank-order claims are weakly supported and highly sensitive to assumptions."

    "validation_notes": "Mixed / uncertain. The post cites real, reputable data sources (GBD/IHME for DALYs; SIPRI for military spending; Climate Policy Initiative for climate finance; 80,000 Hours and Rethink Priorities for farmed-animal funding and welfare ranges; WAI/ProPublica for wild-animal funding). Those source-level facts are verifiable and mostly accurate. However the paper\u2019s headline empirical conclusions (wild-animal suffering >> factory farming >> conflicts >> pandemics >> climate, and extreme cost\u2011effectiveness multipliers like SWP being tens of thousands of times more cost\u2011effective than GiveWell) depend on very large, uncertain, and partly philosophical conversions: (a) converting animal welfare-range estimates into DALY\u2011equivalents, (b) choosing DALYs-per-animal\u2011year values, and (c) many multiplicative BotEC assumptions about populations, suffering intensities, and counterfactual impacts. These transformation steps are highly model\u2011dependent and contested in the literature; small changes in the welfare-range or DALY conversion assumptions produce enormously different rankings. In short: the underlying data sources exist and are cited correctly, but the central inferential steps are speculative and have high epistemic uncertainty, so the numerical conclusions should be treated as illustrative rather than robust.",
