    "explanation": "Practical and useful update: the post nicely aggregates and highlights expanded resources for pursuing US policy careers on emerging tech (AI, biosecurity, etc.), which can materially help EAs who are trying to enter high-impact policy work. However, it is not a novel or foundational argument and doesn't substantially change the broader EA/AI-safety worldview or strategy. Its direct impact on general humanity is minimal \u2014 it helps a subset of career-seekers but has little standalone consequence for large-scale outcomes."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Disclose any relationship and add a quick evaluation of Emerging Tech Policy. You name Emerging Tech Policy as the primary resource but don\u2019t say whether you (or EA DC) helped produce it, have any institutional relationship, or how you vetted its quality. Readers will assume you\u2019re endorsing it as a trusted source \u2014 be explicit. Actionable: add one sentence disclosing any connection (or explicitly state there isn\u2019t one) and 2\u20133 bullets summarizing why you trust it (e.g., authorship, user feedback, freshness, coverage) plus 1\u20132 quick limitations (e.g., US-focus, density of content). This avoids perceived bias and helps readers weigh the recommendation.\n\n2) Give concise, high-leverage decision guidance so readers know which links to follow. Right now the post is a long list of links without guidance on who should start where or the biggest trade-offs of policy careers (time to impact, required credentials, typical routes). Actionable: add a very short \"If you are X, start here\" rubric (e.g., undergrad \u279c policy internships/Google Public Policy Fellowship; STEM PhD \u279c AAAS/TechCongress/agency lab roles; non\u2011US citizen or not willing to relocate \u279c state/local or NGO routes), plus one-sentence notes on expected timelines and effort (e.g., ~1\u20133 years to get an initial federal internship; security/citizenship/time-to-impact). This helps readers act instead of being overwhelmed.\n\n3) Call out high\u2011impact caveats readers will expect but you haven\u2019t mentioned. Several practical and ethical constraints materially affect whether a policy path is a good fit: citizenship/clearance requirements, partisan vs nonpartisan tradeoffs, risk of contributing to harmful programs, and opportunity cost compared to non\u2011policy EA careers. Actionable: add a short \"Be aware\" bullet list with these items and 1\u20132 links or suggested readings (e.g., on clearance/citizenship rules, ethical considerations of government work, and quick comparisons to research/advocacy timelines). That prevents readers from missing major blockers and reduces downstream questions.",
    "improvement_potential": "This feedback correctly calls out three fairly important omissions that harm the post\u2019s usefulness and credibility: (1) a missing disclosure/evaluation of Emerging Tech Policy (readers will assume endorsement and the author\u2019s EA DC role makes this especially salient), (2) lack of concise, actionable signposting for different audiences (the post is a long link list that many readers won\u2019t know where to start), and (3) missing high\u2011impact caveats (citizenship/clearance, partisan vs nonpartisan tradeoffs, opportunity cost) that are common blockers. Implementing these changes would be high\u2011leverage and need not substantially lengthen the post (a sentence or two for disclosure, a 3\u20134 item rubric, and a short caveats bullet list). These are not fatal errors but are important \u201cown goals\u201d the author would likely want to fix."

    "explanation": "This post is primarily a curated update linking and summarizing existing career resources (Emerging Tech Policy Careers, 80,000 Hours, Go Government). For EA Forum readers \u2014 who are already familiar with these venues and the broad idea of policy-career guides \u2014 the content is not conceptually new (minor novelty from recent specific page additions and fellowship guides). For the general public, the specific curated compilation might be somewhat unfamiliar, but the underlying ideas (career guides, agency profiles, fellowship listings) are common and not especially original."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post is clear, focused, and well-structured \u2014 it states a narrow thesis (an existing resource has expanded and is worth checking out) and supports it with direct, concrete links to the new guides and related resources. It benefits from the author\u2019s relevant role and from listing specific new content. Weaknesses: There is little empirical evidence about the quality or impact of the resources (no user outcomes, usage metrics, reviews, or comparative evaluation). Claims that the material is \u201cgreat\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d are largely subjective and rely on authority rather than systematic evidence. Overall, the claim that useful resources exist and have expanded is well-supported; the claim that they are high-impact or best-in-class is only weakly supported."

    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 9,
    "validation_notes": "Most of the post\u2019s factual claims are accurate and easily verifiable. The Horizon / EmergingTechPolicy site (emergingtechpolicy.org) publishes the institution- and topic-specific career guides the author lists (AI policy, biosecurity, multilateral governance, intelligence community, state-level work, executive-branch agency profiles including OSTP/OMB/NSC, DoD, HHS/NIH/CDC, ARPAs, tactical pages on resumes/cover letters/LinkedIn/pitching, a researching-federal-agencies guide, and expanded internship listings). Many of the pages show recent updates (2024\u20132025) consistent with the author\u2019s claim that the site expanded since March 2024. The other two recommended resources (80,000 Hours career reviews and job board; and the Partnership for Public Service\u2019s GoGovernment Federal Internship Finder) also exist and contain the relevant policy-career content. The author\u2019s role as Director / Executive Director of Effective Altruism DC is confirmed on EA DC\u2019s site. No major empirical errors were found; because the post is primarily a pointer to external resources, the remaining uncertainty is limited to timing phrasing (e.g., \u201cover the past few months\u201d is broadly supported but some pages were added/updated across 2024\u20132025).",
