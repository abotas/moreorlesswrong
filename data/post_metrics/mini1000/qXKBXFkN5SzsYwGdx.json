    "explanation": "For the EA/rationalist community this is moderately important: clarifying and systematizing which epistemic methods are more or less reliable can materially improve prioritization, debate quality, and cross-cause comparisons, so the post is a useful, somewhat load\u2011bearing contribution to community reasoning though not foundational or transformative. For general humanity it is of minor importance: the topic is broadly useful (better ways to weigh evidence) but niche, largely relevant to people doing high\u2011stakes decision analysis, and unlikely to change mass outcomes unless widely adopted and implemented."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Make the ranking operational and testable. Right now the tiers feel intuitive but underspecified. Add explicit criteria you used to rank methods (e.g., reliability/accuracy, calibration, robustness to bias, scalability, susceptibility to manipulation), show how those criteria map to each tier, and include 3\u20135 short case studies or historical examples (one per EA-relevant domain) that demonstrate the methods succeeding or failing. This both defends the ranking and makes it possible for readers to contest specific judgments rather than the whole framework.\n\n2) Treat domain-dependence and method-aggregation as first-class issues. A large implicit assumption is that a single tiered ordering applies broadly \u2014 that\u2019s false in many EA-relevant cases (e.g., high-level AI theory vs. medical RCTs). Add a concise decision rule for what to do when high-tier methods are unavailable or give conflicting results (e.g., how to weight theory, models, expert judgment, and empirical evidence; when to run red-team/replication/forecasts). Include explicit guidance for at least two hard, realistic edge cases (e.g., AI existential risk, longtermist policy, animal welfare interventions) so readers can see how the framework works in practice.\n\n3) Explicitly discuss failure modes, incentives, and social harms of publishing a tier list. Rank-lists can entrench authority, crowd out minority but legitimate perspectives, and be gamed by actors who optimize for appearing to use \"high-tier\" methods. Add a short section listing plausible failure modes (consensus error, publication bias, institutional capture), and practical mitigations (replication requirements, pre-registration/forecasting, diverse epistemic communities, red teams). This will reduce the chance your post becomes an \"own goal\" by encouraging overconfidence or inappropriate deference.",
    "improvement_potential": "This feedback hits key, high-impact gaps: the tiers are underspecified (so readers can dismiss them as hand-wavy), the post treats a single ordering as broadly applicable when domain-dependence matters, and it omits likely failure modes and incentives that could make the list do harm or be gamed. Addressing these would substantially raise the post\u2019s credibility and reduce embarrassing \u2018own goals\u2019 (overconfidence, crowding out minority perspectives, being easily gamed). Implementing the suggestions requires some added content (criteria, a few short case studies, and a compact failure-modes section) but need not unduly bloat the piece."

    "author_fame_humanity": 1,
    "explanation": "I cannot find evidence that an author named 'Linch' (or that pseudonym) is known within the EA/rationalist networks or more broadly up to my 2024-06 knowledge cutoff. No prominent posts on EA Forum, LessWrong, 80,000 Hours, Rethink Priorities, or major journals/press under that name; likely a very minor or anonymous/ niche author. If you can provide a link or sample work, I can give a more precise assessment."

  "PostClarity": {
    "post_id": "qXKBXFkN5SzsYwGdx",
    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The post is generally clear, well-structured, and communicates its purpose and audience (EA community) effectively; the core argument \u2014 making implicit epistemic hierarchies explicit to improve decision-making \u2014 is easy to grasp and the call for feedback is explicit. Weaknesses: the excerpt is a teaser rather than substantive (no concrete example tiers or headline claims), contains a couple of rhetorical asides and mild repetition, so readers must follow the link for the actual framework; adding a short summary of the proposed tiers would improve immediate clarity."

  "PostNovelty": {
    "post_id": "qXKBXFkN5SzsYwGdx",
    "novelty_ea": 4,
    "novelty_humanity": 3,
    "explanation": "The core move\u2014making implicit hierarchies of evidence explicit and building a pluralistic, fluid \u2018tier list\u2019 of epistemic methods\u2014is sensible and useful but not especially novel. Within EA and related communities there are already many meta\u2011epistemic discussions (evidence hierarchies, \u2018ways of knowing\u2019, epistemic status disclaimers, and debates about when to rely on theory vs. data), so most readers will see familiar territory; the post\u2019s contribution is mainly in packaging and applying those ideas to EA decision\u2011making. For the general public the notion of ranking evidence (e.g., evidence pyramids in medicine, trusting instruments over intuition) is also commonplace. The most original aspects are the explicit, applied framing for high\u2011stakes, longtermist contexts and the attempt to create a flexible, integrative framework for domains where high\u2011tier methods are unavailable \u2014 useful but incremental rather than breakthrough."

    "reasoning_quality": 6,
    "evidence_quality": 3,
    "overall_support": 5,
    "explanation": "Based on the excerpt, the core idea\u2014making implicit hierarchies of epistemic methods explicit and using that to improve decision-making\u2014is plausible and coherently motivated. Strengths: it addresses a real EA need for clearer meta-reasoning, promotes practical heuristics, and encourages pluralism and context-sensitivity. Weaknesses: the excerpt provides little concrete argumentation about how tiers are chosen, how conflicts between methods are resolved, or how the framework avoids reifying biased or domain-specific heuristics. Empirical support appears limited in the provided text (few or no cited studies, tests, or case studies), so claims about what \u201cactually works\u201d are under-supported. Rating is provisional because I could only evaluate the intro/summary; the full post may contain stronger argumentation and evidence that would raise these scores."

    "validation_notes": "The post\u2019s core empirical claims \u2014 that people and institutions use implicit hierarchies of epistemic methods, that formal evidence hierarchies exist and that methods like RCTs/systematic reviews tend to be more reliable for causal claims while anecdotes/intuitions are weaker, that mechanistic reasoning and triangulation have legitimate roles but also limits, and that there are reproducibility/external\u2011validity problems in science \u2014 are well supported by the literature. Authoritative frameworks (GRADE, OCEBM, US What\u2011Works/ESSA tiers) document explicit hierarchies in practice; meta\u2011research (Ioannidis; the Reproducibility Project) documents systemic reliability problems; philosophical and methodological work (Cartwright; Howick et al.; AHRQ) documents both the strengths and limits of RCTs and mechanistic reasoning; and methodological triangulation is widely recommended. Weaknesses: the post\u2019s specific tier ordering is necessarily partly normative and context\u2011dependent and the author does not appear to provide systematic, domain\u2011specific empirical tests of each ranking. In short: the high\u2011level empirical claims are well supported, but the specific ranking choices are plausible but not exhaustively empirically validated across all domains.",
