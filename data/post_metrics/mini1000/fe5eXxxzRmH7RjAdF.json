    "explanation": "This is practical, niche career advice that matters for a nontrivial subset of the EA/rationalist community (particularly those aiming for government or sensitive AI policy roles in the US). If true, it can prevent avoidable reputational/career costs, but it is not foundational to EA/worldview or broadly load\u2011bearing for the movement. For general humanity the post is of very limited importance \u2014 relevant only to US political-donation rules and a small set of career paths."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Unsupported, overbroad factual claims \u2014 add evidence and narrow scope. You assert that tiny donations (\"~$3\", \"under $10\", \"under $100\") are commonly used to disqualify people from AI policy/government roles, but you provide no sources and you treat all roles and jurisdictions as equivalent. Action: cite FEC/state disclosure rules and any concrete anecdotes or policies showing employers/administrations actually screen and penalize for small donations. If you don\u2019t have citations, reframe this as a tentative, anecdotal warning and explicitly limit it to the specific contexts it plausibly affects (e.g., politically appointed federal positions, highly public roles, particular states).\n\n2) Arbitrary threshold and unclear practical guidance \u2014 make your recommendation conditional and give alternatives. Saying \"consider not donating under $100\" reads arbitrary and could be misunderstood. Action: explain why you picked $100 (if there\u2019s a reason), or remove the numeric threshold and give clear conditional rules: e.g., \"If you anticipate applying for a federal political appointment or a nonpartisan policy job, avoid making publicly attributed candidate donations; instead give to nonprofits, issue advocacy groups, or party committees that don\u2019t publicize individual donors.\" Provide a short list of lawful, concrete alternatives (donor-advised funds, charities, noncandidate advocacy orgs) and note limits/legalities rather than leaving readers guessing.\n\n3) Overlooks plausible counterarguments and tradeoffs \u2014 acknowledge costs of discouraging small donations. Many readers will value transparency, civic engagement, or the signal small donations send to communities or candidates. Action: add a brief paragraph weighing these tradeoffs (transparency vs. career flexibility), and when you think the career-risk argument should be prioritized. That prevents your post from sounding like blanket civic discouragement and helps readers make an informed personal decision.",
    "improvement_potential": "Highly useful. The feedback pinpoints the post's major weaknesses: unsupported factual claims about small donations disqualifying candidates, an unexplained/arbitrary numeric threshold, and failure to acknowledge tradeoffs or offer concrete alternatives. Fixing these would prevent reader confusion and potential embarrassment and would not require a large rewrite\u2014just added citations, clearer scope/wording, and a short section on alternatives and tradeoffs."

    "explanation": "Daniel Filan is known within AI\u2011alignment / EA online spaces (LessWrong, Alignment Forum, similar forums) as an occasional contributor and researcher \u2014 people who follow technical alignment work will recognize the name, but he is not a major public-facing EA figure or frequent high-profile speaker. Outside those communities he has virtually no public recognition."

    "post_id": "fe5eXxxzRmH7RjAdF",
    "clarity_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The post is overall clear, concise, and easy to follow: it states a single actionable concern (small political donations are public and can harm future government-career prospects), gives caveats (epistemic status, US focus, personal view), and offers a simple recommendation. Weaknesses: it uses inconsistent numeric thresholds (mentions <$10, $3, and a $100 cutoff in the title/recommendation) which creates confusion, and it lacks supporting evidence or concrete guidance (how common this problem is, what counts as 'small', or practical alternatives). A more tightly structured argument and consistent figures would improve clarity."

    "explanation": "The core claim \u2014 political donations are public and can complicate later government-facing careers \u2014 is well-known and often discussed in career/advice communities (including EA/AI governance circles). The specific practical rule of thumb (avoid very small donations; threshold ~ $100) is a modest, actionable nuance that may be new to many ordinary donors, but it isn\u2019t a highly original insight."

    "evidence_quality": 2,
    "overall_support": 3,
    "explanation": "Strengths: the post raises a plausible, practical concern (political donations are at least partly public and can be used to infer partisanship, which could matter for later government hiring) and sensibly urges people to weigh long-term career risks. Weaknesses: the argument is largely anecdotal and informal, offers no citations or empirical data, and uses an unexplained threshold ($100) and dramatic examples (e.g. $3 wrecking a career) without substantiation. It also oversimplifies disclosure rules and vetting practices (reporting thresholds differ by context and small donations are often not itemized), ignores mitigation options, and provides no evidence about how often small donations have actually harmed applicants. The claim is plausible but weakly supported."
