    "explanation": "This is a low-cost, useful piece of community feedback: it helps EA organisers understand self-reported causal impact of EA on members' choices and gather anecdotes for outreach. However it\u2019s not load-bearing \u2014 it\u2019s a self-selected, self-report poll with strong biases and limited external validity, so its conclusions wouldn\u2019t meaningfully change major EA or policy decisions. For general humanity it\u2019s essentially irrelevant."

    "robustness_score": 4,
    "actionable_feedback": "1) The core question is a vague, hard-to-evaluate counterfactual. \"I'd be doing less good\" and the nearby-world framing leave respondents unsure what to compare (career, donations, cause selection, effectiveness?). Actionable fix: either (a) break the question into concrete subitems (e.g. \"Would you be donating less / working in a different field / making different career choices if you hadn't heard of EA?\") or (b) add a brief definition of what \"doing less good\" means and a fixed timeframe (e.g. impact to date or expected lifetime impact). This will reduce noise and make answers interpretable.\n\n2) You\u2019re asking a self-attribution question with very large biases (selection bias, social-desirability, hindsight/self-serving and recall bias). Newsletter readers are a non-representative, already-engaged sample, so results will overstate EA\u2019s counterfactual causal impact if treated as general evidence. Actionable fix: add an explicit caveat in the poll text about these biases, collect quick controls (when they first heard of EA, whether they were already in a high-impact job, baseline donation/career intentions), and ask for brief supporting examples or objective indicators (e.g. donation amounts before/after) to validate claims.\n\n3) The deterministic/infinite-world footnote is philosophically distracting and will confuse many respondents without improving data quality. Actionable fix: remove or replace it with a simple instruction: \"Please imagine the closest realistic counterfactual in which you never heard of EA (e.g. same upbringing, same opportunities, but no EA).\" If you want to preserve nuance, add an optional clarification rather than burying it in a jargony footnote.\n\nImplementing these changes will make the poll easier to answer, reduce common cognitive/bias problems, and produce more useful, interpretable responses without substantially increasing length.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback correctly identifies important, actionable problems: the poll question is vague and hard to interpret, self-attribution and selection biases will seriously distort results, and the deterministic/infinite-world footnote is likely confusing and unnecessary. The suggested fixes (breaking into subitems or defining terms/timeframe, adding bias caveats and quick controls, simplifying the counterfactual instruction) are practical and would materially improve data quality and interpretability without huge length increases."

    "explanation": "The post is mostly clear: it gives context (newsletter link, relation to last month), states the personal nature of the poll, and asks for examples if respondents agree. Minor issues reduce clarity slightly \u2014 the determinist/possible-worlds instruction is wordy and could confuse some readers, the footnote markers are a bit distracting, and it would help to state the poll question explicitly and clarify what counts as \u201cagree\u201d on the response scale."

    "explanation": "This is a straightforward, personal poll about whether hearing of EA increased one\u2019s impact \u2014 a very common kind of question on the Forum and in movement communities. The small novel elements are the explicit \u2018nearby possible world\u2019 clarification for determinists and the invitation for concrete examples of impact, but the core idea (asking if a movement changed your effectiveness) is neither new to EA readers nor to the general public."

    "explanation": "The post does not present an argument or empirical results\u2014it's a simple self-report poll prompt\u2014so logical structure is minimal but clear (asks a counterfactual question and notes a determinism caveat). Major weaknesses: it relies entirely on respondents' subjective counterfactuals, contains no data, and offers no controls for bias. Key biases and methodological problems (selection bias, social-desirability bias, survivorship/recall bias, vague outcome metric \"doing good\", substitution effects, and difficulty of credible counterfactual inference) are not addressed. The prompt could generate useful subjective data if analysed carefully, but as presented it provides little reasoning or evidence to support the implied thesis that learning about EA causally increases respondents' impact."
