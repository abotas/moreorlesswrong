    "explanation": "This is a high-quality, policy\u2011relevant synthesis of a moderately neglected but potentially catastrophic climate risk. If the paper\u2019s central claims (substantial AMOC collapse risk and ~11% global crop decline \u2192 hundreds of millions food\u2011insecure) are correct, the implications for resilience, contingency planning, and philanthropic prioritization within EA are substantial \u2014 making it load\u2011bearing for marginal funding and strategy choices. However, large model and probability uncertainties mean it\u2019s not yet foundational to longtermist worldviews; for general humanity the stakes would be huge if realized, but current uncertainties temper its immediate priority compared with better\u2011established risks. Overall, it merits more attention, targeted research, and preparedness investment."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Overstating / selectively citing AMOC collapse probability. The paper leans on high-end and non-consensus estimates (e.g., Smolders 2024, Ditlevsen 2023) without reconciling them with the IPCC\u2019s much lower central estimate. That makes the risk framing look one-sided and can mislead readers about how likely a collapse is. Actionable fixes: add an explicit probabilistic model or scenario table that shows low/medium/high collapse scenarios, explain which studies drive each scenario, and run results under the IPCC central range as well as high-end tails. Be explicit about priors and how you weight different studies (don\u2019t implicitly treat all citations as equally probable).  \n\n2) Food-impact modeling is opaque and likely over-simplified. The headline ~11% global yield decline and the 100\u2013500M figure appear to come from a weighted averaging of heterogeneous regional estimates and rough price-elasticity assumptions. That approach risks large structural errors because it omits (a) process-based crop models, (b) explicit treatment of trade, substitution, storage, and market-mediated responses, and (c) uncertainty propagation. Actionable fixes: (i) publish the raw data, weights, and code used to compute the 11% and the food-price/undernourished estimates; (ii) run sensitivity analyses (e.g., different weighting schemes, alternative yield-loss papers, and explicit price-elasticity parameters); and (iii) where possible use or at least benchmark against process-based crop models (e.g., DSSAT, LPJmL) or existing multi-model ensembles to show how robust the headline numbers are.  \n\n3) Claims about human impacts and cost-effectiveness are overconfident given current uncertainty and missing counterfactuals. Phrases like \u201c~300 million people at risk of starvation \u2014 about 45\u00d7 the COVID-19 death toll\u201d pack a lot of rhetorical punch but conflate undernourishment, starvation, mortality, and affordability in ways that aren\u2019t justified by the presented methods. The paper also suggests preparedness/adaptation work is unusually cost-effective without comparing it to other marginal EA interventions. Actionable fixes: (i) separate and clarify metrics (e.g., caloric deficiency vs mortality vs severe food insecurity) and show how you convert yield shocks to each metric; (ii) present ranges and confidence intervals for humanitarian impacts and clearly label assumptions used to convert prices \u2192 people affected; and (iii) avoid normative cost-effectiveness claims unless you include at least a rough counterfactual or benchmarking exercise (e.g., dollars per DALY or lives saved versus comparable EA interventions). \n\nAddressing these three issues (probabilities, transparent & more realistic food-system modeling, and tempering/benchmarking impact claims) will make the working paper much stronger and reduce the risk of own-goal criticisms when you publish on EA Forum.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback identifies the paper\u2019s three biggest weaknesses (probability framing, opaque/simple food-impact modeling, and overconfident human-impact/cost-effectiveness claims) and gives concrete, actionable fixes. Those are the central issues that could mislead readers or make the work vulnerable to strong criticism. Addressing them would substantially strengthen credibility without requiring a complete rewrite (data/code can be appended; scenario tables and sensitivity analyses can be summarized). It stops short of claiming the core thesis is outright wrong, hence not a 9\u201310, but it is high-impact and practically useful."

    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "Strengths: Well-structured with a clear abstract, logical headings, summary table, and concrete recommendations. Main claim (AMOC risk \u2192 meaningful global food impacts) is stated early and supported with cited evidence, figures, and a quantifiable estimate, making the post easy to follow for readers with some climate literacy. Weaknesses: Dense and technical in places, with several long sections that assume background knowledge; key modeling assumptions (how the ~11% yield loss and price/people-at-risk numbers were derived) are not fully explained in-line, which reduces persuasive clarity for non-experts. Minor redundancy/formatting issues (reused figure numbers, some repetition) slightly detract from conciseness. Overall clear and well-organized but could be more concise and make key methods/uncertainties more explicit for a broader EA audience."

    "explanation": "For an EA Forum audience the core claims are only modestly novel: EAs and longtermists have already discussed climate tipping points, systemic food risks, and the idea that marginal funding to preparedness/adaptation can be high-impact. What is somewhat new to that audience is the specific, quantified working\u2011paper framing (the ~11% global yield drop, 100\u2013500M additional undernourished, and the application of the Global Catastrophic Food Failure criteria to AMOC) and the explicit operational push toward resilience research / contingency planning. For the general educated public the piece is considerably more novel: the AMOC-as-cause-of-global food\u2011system collapse, the detailed regional yield and price projections, and the technical early\u2011warning indicators and adaptation recommendations are likely unfamiliar to most people."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post is well-structured, cites a wide range of relevant, recent literature (IPCC, Science, Nature, PNAS, etc.), explicitly acknowledges major uncertainties, and plausibly connects an AMOC collapse to large-scale climate and food-system impacts. Weaknesses: Key quantitative claims (the ~11% global crop-yield decline, 30\u2013100% food\u2011price shock, and 100\u2013500M additional undernourished) rest on a coarse, non\u2011transparent aggregation and preliminary modeling without sufficient methodological detail or sensitivity analysis; important adaptive responses (trade shifts, CO2 fertilization, crop switching, policy buffers) are under\u2011modeled; the probability of AMOC collapse is highly contested but not risk\u2011weighted in the conclusions; and there are some conceptual slips (confusing language about AMOC historical cycles). Overall, the argument is credible enough to warrant further attention and research, but the strongest claims require more rigorous, transparent modeling and explicit probabilistic reasoning before making resource\u2011allocation recommendations."

    "validation_notes": "Strengths: The post accurately represents mainstream climate science about the AMOC \u2014 IPCC AR6 assesses the AMOC is very likely to weaken this century but an abrupt collapse within the 21st century is assessed as very unlikely; multiple observational and modelling studies show recent weakening / low historical state (Caesar et al. 2018/2021) and several papers identify early\u2011warning indicators and plausible large regional climate impacts (Boers 2021; van Westen et al. 2024; Armstrong McKay et al. 2022; Jackson et al. 2015). The author fairly presents the wide range of collapse-probability estimates (from IPCC's low end to higher, contested estimates such as Smolders et al. 2024 and Ditlevsen & Ditlevsen 2023) and notes model uncertainty. Weaknesses / caveats: the post\u2019s central quantitative food-system results (the ~11% global crop-yield decline and the additional ~100\u2013500M people at risk / ~300M figure used for illustration) come from the author\u2019s preliminary modelling and literature synthesis rather than an established, peer\u2011reviewed consensus result; I could not find independent, peer\u2011reviewed studies that produce the same global 11% yield reduction or the exact 100\u2013500M undernourished estimates specifically attributable to an AMOC collapse. High\u2011probability collapse estimates cited (e.g., arXiv Smolders et al. 2024) are preliminary and have been criticized by domain experts; other recent model studies (e.g., Baker et al. 2025) argue for a substantially lower collapse risk under many scenarios. Overall: background claims and qualitative impacts are well supported; the headline numerical food-impact projections are plausible as preliminary, model\u2011based scenarios but are not yet independently validated \u2014 more detailed, peer\u2011reviewed crop-modeling under explicit AMOC collapse scenarios is needed before treating those specific numbers as robust.",
