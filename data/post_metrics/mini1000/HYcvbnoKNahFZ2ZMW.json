    "explanation": "This is a useful, practical post for EA community builders and funders: it gives concrete metrics, lessons about trade-offs (local vs. regional events, travel support, language accessibility), and signals improvements in diversity and cost-effectiveness that can inform event strategy and budgeting. However it is not foundational to core EA or longtermist claims \u2014 if its conclusions were wrong it would mainly affect event planning and regional outreach choices rather than high\u2011stakes priorities. For general humanity the post is essentially irrelevant beyond a small audience of event organizers and local stakeholders."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Fix and clearly label which numbers are extrapolations from a small survey sample (60/182 = 33%). Many headline metrics (average new connections, 1714 total connections, % >10x, gender breakdown, LTR) are calculated from survey respondents but presented as if they apply to all attendees. At minimum: state the response rate prominently next to each such metric, report the raw respondent statistics (N=60) separately, and reword headlines to say \"estimated\" rather than definitive. Preferably add simple sensitivity bounds (e.g., best/worst plausible totals if non-respondents had 0 or the respondent mean). This avoids overstating confidence and reduces the risk of misleading readers.\n\n2) Resolve the methodological inconsistency around \"connections\" and cost-per-connection. You changed the counting rule (no longer dividing by two) and also started including organizer pay in the cost numerator \u2014 both make year-to-year comparisons unreliable. Show both versions side-by-side: (a) connections de-duplicated (divide by two) and prior cost-per-connection method, and (b) current method (no de-duplication) and current cost-per-connection including organizer pay. Explain why you chose the current method and explicitly quantify how much the change affects comparability with prior years. If you keep the new method, add a short justification of why double-counting is preferable despite inflating totals.\n\n3) Call out and (where possible) quantify bias risks from self-reporting and selection. Attendees who filled the survey are plausibly more satisfied and more connected than non-respondents; also social desirability and recall bias can inflate \"impactful\" connection counts. Add one-sentence caveats in the results and consider including the survey question wording and distribution of answers (histograms or counts) in an appendix/link so readers can judge measurement quality. If you want to preserve post length, at least link to the raw survey summary and note the main direction and likely magnitude of bias.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback identifies major methodological and reporting errors that materially affect the credibility of the headline metrics: treating survey-derived numbers as if they applied to all attendees, changing the \u2018\u2018connections\u2019\u2019 counting rule and cost numerator without reconciling year-to-year comparability, and failing to note selection/self-report biases. Fixing these (clearly flagging N=60, labeling estimates, showing alternative accounting methods, and adding brief bias caveats or links to raw survey data) would substantially improve accuracy and avoid potential embarrassment, and can be done with minimal added length."

    "explanation": "Well-structured and easy to follow: begins with a clear BLUF, uses headings, metrics, budget, and concrete examples. Strengths include transparent numbers, explicit trade-offs, and actionable takeaways. Weaknesses: a few comparability caveats (changed connection-counting method and inclusion of organizer pay) are buried in footnotes and may confuse readers comparing years; reliance on a 60-person survey sample could be emphasized earlier; minor repetition and some jargon (e.g., \u201ccounterfactual\u201d) might slow comprehension for newcomers."

    "explanation": "This is largely a standard event retrospective tailored to an EA audience: metrics (attendee counts, cost per attendee/connection, LTR), lessons learned, diversity/language choices, and cost-saving tactics are all familiar to EA Forum readers and to conference organizers more broadly. The most distinctive elements are the explicit shift to Spanish-as-default/localization strategy for Latin America and the specific framing/metric choices (e.g., cost-per-connection including organizer pay and the note about changing double-counting conventions). Those are mildly novel within the EA community but not especially original overall."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post is well-structured, transparent about methods and costs, and explicitly notes trade-offs (e.g., fewer travel subsidies to enable other events). It reports clear metrics (attendance, budget, LTR) and flags methodological choices (how connections were estimated, inclusion of organizer pay). Weaknesses: Key metrics rely on a small, likely non-representative sample (60/182 survey respondents) and on subjective, immediate self-reports of impact; the switch in the connections-counting method (not consistent with prior years) reduces comparability; many claims (e.g., that reallocating travel support will net more regional connections) are plausible but speculative and not yet supported by follow-up data. Overall, the post gives reasonably good, transparent evidence for its main thesis that the event 'went well' operationally and generated valuable connections, but the empirical support is limited by sample bias, short-term self-reporting, and some inconsistent metric choices."

    "validation_notes": "Strengths: The event\u2019s date and venue (March 14\u201316, 2025 at Universum/UNAM) are confirmed on EA\u2019s event page and Universum\u2019s site, and the retrospective itself is publicly posted on the EA Forum \u2014 those primary sources support the high\u2011level claims (attendance, dates, location, and the organizers\u2019 reported metrics). The 2025 post\u2019s comparisons to 2024 largely match figures published in the EAGxLATAM 2024 retrospective (e.g., attendance ~253 in 2024; connections reported for 2024). Weaknesses / limits: Most of the detailed numeric claims (182 attendees, budget line items totalling $120,849, 60 survey respondents, 40% >10x, 1714 connections, cost-per-connection ~$70.5, 60% women/non-binary, 67% talks in Spanish, 500,000 ad impressions) come from the organizers\u2019 self\u2011report in the EA Forum post and cannot be independently verified from public sources. There is also an internal accounting inconsistency to note: the EAGxLATAM 2024 retrospective states total 2024 spending $126,849 \u2192 $501 per participant (explicitly excluding team wages), whereas the 2025 post compares a 2024 \u201ccost per attendee\u201d of $676 \u2014 the posts appear to use different accounting conventions (e.g., inclusion/exclusion of organizer pay), which reduces confidence in direct year\u2011to\u2011year comparisons unless the organizers clarify the accounting basis. Overall assessment: credible and plausible (organizers transparently state survey sample = 60 and give footnotes on methodology), but reliant on self\u2011reported survey & accounting data and with at least one notable inconsistency, so validation is moderate rather than strong.",
