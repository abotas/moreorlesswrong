    "explanation": "This is a community-building/accountability thread that can modestly boost members' productivity, collaboration, and morale \u2014 useful but not foundational. If true or false it has limited downstream impact on major EA or world-scale outcomes; its benefits are local and incremental rather than critical."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Add a short, copy-pasteable template and encourage SMART-style goals. Right now posts will be very heterogeneous and hard to respond to. A one-paragraph template (goal, deadline, measurable success criteria, why it matters to you) plus a line for the specific help requested (and preferred contact/check-in cadence) will increase signal-to-noise and make it easier for others to offer useful help.\n\n2) Provide an explicit follow-up/accountability plan. Threads like this often die after the first wave of posts. Describe how follow-ups should work: e.g. monthly check-in comments, an opt-in volunteer \u2018accountability buddy\u2019 system, or asking posters whether they want a reminder (and by what channel). If moderation resources are limited, say so and suggest low-effort options (automated reminders, pinned fortnightly progress threads) so commitments are realistic.\n\n3) Give brief guidance about reasonable asks and privacy. Tell people what kinds of help are appropriate (feedback, introductions, time-limited reviews) and discourage heavy asks that require large ongoing commitments unless clearly labelled. Remind posters not to share sensitive personal info and to prefer public follow-up or explicit opt-in for direct messages. This will reduce friction and protect both helpers and help-seekers.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback targets real, practical weaknesses: heterogenous posts reduce reply usefulness (template/SMART fixes this), lack of follow-up makes accountability threads fizzle (explicit check-ins/opt-ins would materially increase impact), and absence of guidance risks privacy issues and unreasonable asks. These are not fatal but are important usability and safety improvements that can be added concisely, so addressing them would meaningfully raise the thread\u2019s value."

    "explanation": "Very clear and easy to understand: concise instructions, concrete examples, and a simple two-part prompt (goal + how others can help). Well-structured and suitable for a community thread. Minor improvements could be to specify any preferred timeframe/detail level or moderation expectations, but these are not necessary for basic understanding."

    "explanation": "This is a routine New Year's goals and accountability thread \u2014 very common both generally and within the EA community. The only mildly specific element is framing it for EA Forum members (offering community accountability/resources), but the core idea is widely used and not original."

    "evidence_quality": 1,
    "overall_support": 3,
    "explanation": "The post is clear and sensible as a community prompt (inviting goal-sharing and accountability), but it offers little explicit reasoning for why this format will reliably help people achieve goals. It assumes accountability/collaboration are beneficial without arguing or specifying mechanisms. No empirical evidence, citations, or follow-up structure are provided to substantiate effectiveness, so overall support for the implicit thesis is weak despite the idea being plausible and low-cost."
