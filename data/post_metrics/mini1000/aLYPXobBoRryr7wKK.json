    "explanation": "This post raises an important empirical puzzle that bears directly on common x-risk and misuse intuitions: if realistic deepfakes are feasible and some actors have motives to deploy them, why aren\u2019t they ubiquitous? For the EA/AI-safety community this is fairly high\u2011value (7) because it challenges a key assumption used in models of technological diffusion and misuse, and could change risk estimates and policy priorities if the explanation generalises to other risky technologies. For general humanity the question is moderately important (5): the presence or absence of large\u2011scale deepfake abuse affects political stability, trust in media, and electoral security, but it\u2019s not a foundational or civilisation\u2011level issue on its own. The post is most useful as a prompt to gather empirical data and refine models (e.g., factors like platform economics, credibility loss, detection/moderation, coordination problems, legal/political costs), rather than as a conclusive claim."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Missing strategic/incentive analysis (big omission). The post assumes \u2018willing + able \u21d2 someone will use deepfakes publicly\u2019, but ignores the actor-level calculus: expected payoff, reputational blowback, risk of attribution and escalation, and the value of alternative tools (leaks, selective editing, disinformation via real footage). Actionable fix: add a short section modeling or listing these incentives and constraints, or give 2\u20133 concrete case-study examples showing why an actor might prefer non-deepfake tactics.\n\n2) Underestimates distribution and detection dynamics. You assume a random video should go viral, but platforms, journalists, and audiences filter content and forensic/detection improvements create both technical and social barriers. Actionable fix: summarize (briefly) how platform moderation, fact-checking, audience heuristics, and detection tools change the expected reach and cost of a deepfake. Cite or point to empirical proxies (platform takedown policies, Deepfake Detection Challenge, or fact-checking workflows) or propose a small empirical check (count political deepfake incidents, takedown rates, or ask moderators) to support the claim.\n\n3) Overlooks existing empirical evidence and alternative manifestations. There already are many deepfakes used in scams, intimate blackmail, or targeted influence campaigns; political actors often prefer manipulating context or amplifying real-but-misleading material. Actionable fix: incorporate a short review paragraph distinguishing (a) private/financial uses, (b) targeted persuasion vs mass viral attacks, and (c) why public, high-profile political deepfakes are comparatively rarer. Recommend adding one or two citations (e.g., industry/academic surveys of deepfake incidents) or suggesting concrete empirical tests the reader could run before accepting the puzzle.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback hits the post's major omissions: it correctly points out the missing actor-level incentives (reputational costs, attribution/escalation, cheaper alternatives), distribution and detection frictions (platform moderation, forensic tools, journalist/audience filtering), and that deepfakes already exist in other domains (scams, blackmail, targeted ops). These are critical to the puzzle and the suggestions are actionable without bloating the post. It would substantially improve the post\u2019s diagnosis and reduce obvious 'own-goals' (oversimplifying willingness\u2192use, ignoring platform dynamics, and neglecting existing empirical evidence)."

    "explanation": "I could not find evidence that 'Spiarrow' is a known figure in the EA/rationalist community or more broadly \u2014 no prominent publications, talks, or leadership roles tied to that name. Likely a pseudonymous or minor online author with little-to-no public recognition. If you can share links or context (platform, notable pieces), I can reassess."

    "post_id": "aLYPXobBoRryr7wKK",
    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The post is succinct and the central question is easy to see: if actors can make convincing deepfakes, why aren't we seeing many high\u2011impact examples? Strengths: short, focused, and gives a plausible hypothesis (virality/platforms) and stakes (implications for x\u2011risk reasoning). Weaknesses: a few vague terms and assumptions (who counts as an \"actor,\" what qualifies as a meaningful deepfake, and how \"viral\" is defined) and no concrete examples or evidence to sharpen the argument. A couple of clarifying details would make it fully unambiguous."

    "novelty_humanity": 3,
    "explanation": "Most of the pieces here are familiar: worries about deepfakes, reasons why they may not go viral (platform norms, virality dynamics, cost/benefit for attackers), and the general claim that observed absence should update our priors. The slightly novel element is framing this absence as a concrete challenge to the common x\u2011risk heuristic (\u2018if many actors can, some will do catastrophic things\u2019) and suggesting recalibration of longtermist/apocalyptic models based on empirical non\u2011occurrence. But that exact observational\u2011calibration point and the specific puzzle about scarce viral deepfakes have been discussed enough that it isn\u2019t highly original for EA readers or the general public."

    "overall_support": 3,
    "explanation": "Strengths: raises a clear, important puzzle and links it to a broader theoretical claim about 'as soon as enough actors have access, some will misuse X', which is worth scrutinizing. Weaknesses: the post is largely speculative and underdeveloped \u2014 it offers only a couple of hand-wavy hypotheses (virality dynamics, role of large media platforms) and does not systematically consider alternative explanations (incentives/costs, detectability and attribution, legal/reputational risks, platform moderation, operational complexity, audience skepticism), nor does it provide data or citations about prevalence, detection rates, or documented incidents. Empirical support is essentially absent. Overall the argument is intriguing but weakly supported and would benefit from more structured reasoning and concrete evidence or proposed tests."

    "validation_notes": "Most of the post\u2019s empirical intuition is supported: state and criminal actors have created and pushed deceptively realistic deepfakes (e.g. Zelensky/other Russia-linked cases, campaigns like \u201cDoppelganger\u201d), but large-scale viral political deepfakes remain rarer than early doomsday predictions suggested. Multiple empirical reviews and platform/agency reports show (a) most detected deepfakes have been non\u2011consensual pornographic content, (b) high\u2011quality viral political deepfakes are costly/time\u2011consuming to produce and often fail (or are removed) before wide spread, and (c) distribution, believability/context, and platform moderation materially limit their impact \u2014 so the post\u2019s puzzle is real. Major weakness: prevalence estimates are noisy and fast\u2011moving (detection methods, platform takedowns, and audio\u2011deepfake use have increased recently), so the situation may change quickly. Overall: well\u2011supported but subject to important data gaps and recent trend risks.",
