    "explanation": "This post targets a cruxy, foundational assumption in AGI strategy: what people mean by 'alignment is solvable in principle'. Clarifying that claim (and the meanings of 'in principle', 'solvable', etc.) materially affects research priorities, risk assessments, funding, and deployment strategy within the EA/AI-safety community, so it is highly load-bearing for community decisions. For general humanity the issue is also important because the underlying truth bears on existential risk and policy choices, but the post is mainly a conceptual/disciplinary clarification rather than new empirical evidence, so its direct impact on non-specialists is somewhat smaller."

    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The post is concise, focused, and easy to follow: it states the problem, explains why the claim matters, gives representative analogies, and asks a clear request for definitions. Strengths include good structure and concrete examples. Minor weaknesses: some jargon ('cruxy') and footnote/link formatting may confuse readers, and the post could more explicitly define key terms (e.g. 'alignment', 'in principle') or give a brief example of the consequences of the different readings."

    "explanation": "Among EA/Alignment readers this is a fairly common meta-level critique \u2014 people have repeatedly asked for clearer definitions of claims like \u201calignment is solvable in principle,\u201d and similar threads exist on LW/EA Forum. The most novel bit for that audience is the explicit call to unpack each term and connect it to research viability, but that is still incremental. For the general educated public, the post is more novel: most people haven't thought in detail about the epistemic status of \u2018solvable in principle\u2019 for AGI alignment, so the request to precisely define terms and the implications for the research community will feel relatively new."

    "explanation": "The post makes a clear, logically coherent point: the claim 'alignment is solvable in principle' is cruxy and under-specified, and it sensibly asks for disambiguation of terms. The argument structure is concise and reasonable. However, empirical support is thin\u2014claims are supported mainly by anecdotal analogies and observation rather than systematic citation or data, and the post does not develop formal definitions or counterarguments. Overall, the thesis (that the claim needs clearer definition and justification) is persuasive but would be stronger with more concrete examples, citations, and more explicit proposed definitions or criteria."

    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 7,
    "validation_notes": "The post\u2019s core empirical claims are well-supported: (a) many alignment researchers do assert\u2014often briefly\u2014that alignment is \"solvable in principle\" or pursue approaches that presuppose solvability (e.g., Paul Christiano\u2019s work on making an aligned variant of existing algorithms); (b) commentators commonly use the informal analogies the author lists (\"humans can align with humans\", \"LLMs already do what we want\", \"other engineering problems were solved\"); and (c) there is an active, visible debate about whether solvability is merely theoretical vs. practically achievable, with influential researchers (e.g., Eliezer Yudkowsky) arguing the opposite. Those facts are verifiable in the public literature and forums. Where the post is weakest (and why I did not give a higher score) is that it is partly an observational / normative claim about discourse (\u201clittle is written disambiguating the claim\u201d): there are some formal/technical papers discussing limits and definitions (e.g., undecidability/limitations results and formal approaches to scalable oversight), so the situation is mixed\u2014there is both informal usage and some technical work, but no single agreed formalization. Overall most major empirical claims in the post check out, but the claim about the absence of disambiguating literature is only partially true (some formal work exists), hence a 7.",

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Make the claim precise up front: say which words you want readers to disambiguate (e.g., \u201csolvable\u201d, \u201cin principle\u201d, \u201calignment\u201d, and the relevant AGI model class). Offer 2\u20133 concrete formalizations you care about (examples: existence of a provably-correct algorithm given unlimited compute; existence of a computable algorithm with polynomial resources; existence of a training+deployment protocol that yields aligned policies with high probability under realistic distributional shifts). Pick one as your main target and indicate why. This avoids a lot of vagueness and lets readers evaluate the argument on shared terms.\n\n2) Address the biggest, well-known counterarguments directly rather than only noting loose analogies. At minimum discuss inner vs outer alignment/mesa-optimization, Goodhart-style failure modes (optimization pressure breaking your objective), reward tampering/observability limits, human values incoherence/elicitation difficulty, multi-agent dynamics, and computational/incomputability concerns. For each, briefly say whether your chosen formalization would be immune, partially vulnerable, or clearly vulnerable. This flags the crucial cruxes and prevents readers assuming you\u2019ve swept important failure modes under the rug.\n\n3) Anchor the discussion in prior work and types of evidence you\u2019d accept. Cite or briefly reference the key papers or frameworks you\u2019re relying on (e.g., Amodei et al. on concrete problems, Hubinger/soares on inner alignment and corrigibility, Goodhart/mesa-optimizer discussions, any formal results you mean). State what would count as evidence that alignment is \u201csolvable in principle\u201d under your formulation (existence proof, an algorithm with provable bounds, empirical demonstrations transferable to stronger systems, etc.). If you want to keep the post short, do this by listing 2\u20133 formalizations + 2\u20133 counterarguments to address and one clear criterion for evidence; you can defer full citations to a short reference list or a follow-up comment.",
    "improvement_potential": "This feedback targets the post's main weaknesses: excessive vagueness about key terms, failure to engage core counterarguments, and lack of criteria/evidence. Making the claim precise, explicitly mapping vulnerabilities (inner/outer alignment, Goodhart, mesa-optimization, etc.), and saying what would count as evidence are high-impact fixes that prevent readers from assuming unstated premises. The suggestions are actionable and mostly short: pick one formalization up front, list 2\u20133 counterarguments to address, and give 1\u20132 evidence criteria. That avoids unnecessary length while removing major 'own-goal' weaknesses. (Minor caveat: the author already signalled an intention to specify terms, so parts of the feedback are partly redundant, but overall it still materially improves the post.)"
