    "explanation": "Modestly useful for the EA community: a practical, low\u2011risk experiment in democratizing and comparing community-leader views with broader EA sentiment. If adopted it could marginally shift internal priorities, legitimacy, or engagement norms, but it isn\u2019t load\u2011bearing for core EA or AI\u2011safety conclusions (results will be non\u2011representative, non\u2011binding and mainly informational). For general humanity it\u2019s essentially irrelevant."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Major sampling / comparison problem: You repeatedly compare EA-at-large responses to MCF (leader) results but haven\u2019t justified that the two samples are comparable. People on MCF are self-selected leaders with different incentives and knowledge. Actionable fixes: explicitly state the inferential target (e.g., \u201cgeneral EA forum users\u201d vs. \u201cEA community at large\u201d), pre-specify and publish recruitment channels, and collect basic demographics and affiliation data so you can show (and/or weight for) differences. If you really want a direct comparison to MCF, preregister the exact comparison and how you\u2019ll adjust for sample differences.\n\n2) Unclear / manipulable selection process for \u201cindependent EAs\u201d and poll integrity risk: Your idea of inviting \u2018independent EAs\u2019 is underspecified (karma thresholds, panel, election), which opens the door to bias or gaming. Also, polls on public forums are vulnerable to duplicate votes, brigading, and bots. Actionable fixes: pick and state one concrete selection mechanism and justify it (e.g., top X users by karma over the last Y months, plus a random invitation pool), publish the roster and selection code/criteria, and run the poll on a platform with vote controls (or require single-use tokens). Consider an appeals/audit process and record IP/metadata where allowed.\n\n3) Question validity & presentation issues (anchoring / oversimplification): The MCF questions were designed for leaders and some are one-dimensional or context-dependent \u2014 they may misrepresent how a broader EA audience thinks. Also, you link to MCF results in the post which risks anchoring despite your caveat. Actionable fixes: pilot each question with a small sample to check clarity and whether answer options capture real views (add neutral/don\u2019t-know, Likert scales, or short comment fields), move MCF links to a spoiler section or remove them until after voting, and preregister your analysis plan (what comparisons/statistics you\u2019ll report) so readers can trust the interpretation.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback pinpoints the post\u2019s core methodological weaknesses \u2014 non-comparable samples (MCF vs EA-at-large), underspecified selection rules for \u2018independent EAs\u2019 and integrity risks, and question/anchoring problems \u2014 and gives clear, actionable fixes (pre-specify target population, publish recruitment/selection code, pilot questions, preregister analysis). These are critical improvements that would substantially raise the post\u2019s credibility without unduly lengthening it. It loses a couple points because it could add brief cautions about privacy/legal limits on metadata/IP logging and note simpler low-effort mitigations (e.g., CAPTCHA, email/token voting) if the author lacks engineering resources."

    "clarity_score": 6,
    "explanation": "The post\u2019s purpose is understandable (run MCF-style polls for the broader EA community and solicit votes), and key points (vote before viewing MCF results; who \u2018independent EAs\u2019 are; possible selection methods) are stated. However the presentation is cluttered: many repetitive link clusters, unclear which polls are active, awkward formatting (repeated MCF links with no labels), and a confusing footnote/edit placement. Overall it\u2019s moderately clear but requires effort to parse and would benefit from a more concise, better-structured layout and explicit list of poll questions/statuses."

    "novelty_humanity": 1,
    "explanation": "Replicating leader-focused MCF polls for the broader EA community is a straightforward, incremental idea that many in the EA community have likely considered (there are already community surveys and discussions about sampling EA views). The mildly novel bits are the specifics: using the EA Forum as the polling medium, the proposal for selecting \u2018independent EAs\u2019 via karma/panel/election, and explicitly comparing leader vs. wider-community answers \u2014 these are modestly original refinements but not a fundamentally new concept."

    "explanation": "Strengths: the proposal is clear, coherent, and modest in scope; the author shows some awareness of anchoring and gives several plausible selection mechanisms. Weaknesses: there is little to no empirical evidence that broader EA Forum polls would be representative or informative compared with MCF results, no discussion of sampling bias, response rates, or incentives, and no pilot data or analyses of likely noise/manipulation. Overall the idea is plausible but under-supported and missing key validity and implementation considerations."

    "validation_notes": "Most empirical claims in the post are accurate and verifiable. Will Aldred\u2019s claims that (a) the Meta Coordination Forum (MCF) runs surveys of invited EA decision\u2011makers, (b) he reused questions from the 2023 MCF survey, and (c) he linked the MCF results throughout his post are all supported by the EA Forum posts cited below (the MCF 2023 posts and Will\u2019s post itself). The AIS field\u2011building survey he references also exists and reports the kinds of splits he cites. Caveats: the MCF surveys are small, non\u2011representative samples of invited attendees (the posts explicitly note caveats about representativeness), so treating MCF results as \u2018EA leaders\u2019 consensus would be misleading. The author\u2019s remark that the 2024 MCF questions weren\u2019t well suited to simple one\u2011dimensional polls is a reasonable subjective judgment but not an objective fact; it\u2019s plausible given the 2024 talent\u2011needs format. Also the edit about polls being closed is a transient, time\u2011dependent status and matches the post\u2019s edit note. Overall, the post\u2019s empirical/descriptive claims are well supported by the cited EA Forum sources.",
