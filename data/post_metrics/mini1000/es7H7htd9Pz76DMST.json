    "explanation": "This is a practical, credible offer that can meaningfully reduce language barriers for EA and high\u2011impact projects (translation/proofreading in 4 major languages, CIOL accreditation). If taken up, it can increase reach, inclusivity, and uptake of critical research (AI safety, biosecurity, global health), so it has clear but localized utility. It is not foundational or transformative on its own \u2014 impact is incremental and depends on uptake and scale \u2014 so it rates as moderately important to the EA community and of minor importance to general humanity."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Be explicit about selection criteria and capacity. The term \u201chigh-impact organisations\u201d is vague and invites a flood of low-priority requests. Add a short, concrete prioritisation rule (e.g., EA-aligned orgs, projects with clear expected impact, word-count/complexity caps, or a first-come/limited-hours-per-month policy). Consider an intake form or ask requesters to include a one-paragraph impact justification, target audience, and deadline \u2014 this will save you and requesters time.\n\n2) Clarify scope, quality controls, and turnaround expectations. The post doesn\u2019t say how much you\u2019ll do free of charge, what formats you accept, expected turnaround, or whether technical content will be peer-reviewed. State typical limits (words/hour, max words per pro-bono task), whether you provide native-speaker proofreading, whether you use CAT tools/glossaries, and if you can sign NDAs. If you can\u2019t handle highly technical content alone, say so and describe when you\u2019ll consult a subject expert.\n\n3) Add brief evidence of domain-relevant experience or a low-effort sample option. You note professional credentials, but readers will want reassurance you can translate technical AI/biosecurity reports accurately. Add 1\u20132 short examples (anonymised if necessary), a link to a portfolio/sample translation, or offer to do a free short sample (e.g., 200\u2013300 words) so requesters can judge fit. This reduces wasted back-and-forth and increases uptake from serious projects.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback identifies clear, actionable gaps that are likely to cause practical problems (influx of low-priority requests, unclear scope/turnaround, trust concerns about technical accuracy). Fixing these would materially improve the post without much extra length and would prevent real operational headaches. It misses a few minor items (e.g., confidentiality/privacy specifics, payment/long-term engagement terms), but overall targets the most important omissions."

    "clarity_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The post is very clear: well-structured, easy to skim, and states the offer, target cause areas, languages, credentials, and contact info. The rationale for the offer is concise and persuasive. Minor weaknesses: it could briefly specify capacity, turnaround, directionality (which language pairs/dominant native language), and any limits or examples of past work to make the offer fully actionable."

    "explanation": "Offering pro-bono translation/proofreading targeted at high-impact causes is useful but not new. On the EA Forum, skill-offer posts and volunteer translators are common, so this is low-novelty. To the general public, volunteering translation work for NGOs is also familiar, though the explicit targeting of EA/longtermist cause areas gives it slightly more specificity."

    "reasoning_quality": 6,
    "evidence_quality": 3,
    "overall_support": 4,
    "explanation": "Strengths: The post presents a simple, logical claim \u2014 that translation and linguistic support reduce language barriers and can increase reach and uptake of high\u2011impact ideas \u2014 and the offer is targeted to relevant cause areas and languages. The author also cites professional credentials (Chartered Linguist, translation certificate), which supports competence. Weaknesses: The argument is thinly developed and informal \u2014 no theory of change, no discussion of localization vs. literal translation, target audiences, prioritisation, QA processes, or scalability. Empirical evidence is minimal: no examples of past impact, no metrics, no citations showing how much translation increases uptake, and no discussion of potential pitfalls (misinterpretation, contextualization). Overall, the claim is plausible and credible at a basic level, but under\u2011supported by evidence and lacking detail needed to assess likely impact or implementation quality."

    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 7,
    "validation_notes": "The post's general empirical claim \u2014 that language barriers limit access to high\u2011impact ideas and that translation/linguistic services can increase reach, uptake and equitable participation \u2014 is well supported by peer\u2011reviewed research and reputable organisations (studies on English dominance in science, health outcomes for people with limited English proficiency, and documented COVID\u201119 communication gaps). CIOL (Chartered Institute of Linguists) is a real UK professional body that issues Chartered Linguist status and translation qualifications (CertTrans/DipTrans), so the author\u2019s claim that such credentials exist is plausible. However, I could not independently verify the specific personal claims (the author\u2019s CIOL Chartered Linguist registration or the named Graduate Certificate in Translation) from public CIOL directories or other public records using the names/email provided, so those personal credentials remain unverified from available public sources. Overall: strong external evidence supports the importance of the work offered; the poster\u2019s claimed organisational accreditation is plausible but not externally confirmed with the available public records.",
