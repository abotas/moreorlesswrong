    "explanation": "This is a well\u2011crafted, comprehensive defense of expected\u2011value \u2018fanaticism\u2019 that synthesizes and advances several technical arguments (partial dominance, independence, indology/Background Independence, Carlsmith, scale\u2011independence, etc.). For the EA/rationalist community it is highly load\u2011bearing: if its conclusions are accepted, they substantially strengthen longtermist priorities (AI/xrisk, tiny\u2011probability huge\u2011value interventions), affect donation and career guidance, and shape core decision\u2011theoretic assumptions. For general humanity the post\u2019s implications are large in principle (reallocating resources toward minimizing tiny risks that could produce enormous value would be transformational), but its technical nature, contested premises, and philosophical controversy limit its immediate practical influence beyond policy and academic circles."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Be explicit and formal about your axioms and the scope where your arguments apply. Right now you move between informal intuitions, named principles (Partial Dominance, 99% Independence, Scale Independence, Background Independence, Negative Reflection), and broad dismissal of alternatives, but you rarely (a) state the exact formal assumptions you need for each proof, (b) show a short formal derivation, or (c) say when the argument applies (finite cases only? rules out certain probability weightings?). Actionable fixes: (i) for each major implication (\u201cA+B of principles => fanaticism\u201d), list the premises formally and give a one-paragraph proof sketch or citation; (ii) state up front whether you permit non-linear probability weighting, lexicographic rules, or any continuity/boundedness assumptions; (iii) if you intend to exclude certain pathological infinite cases, give a principled restriction (not just \u201cinfinities are Satan\u201d) \u2014 e.g. restrict to gambles with finite expectation or to utility functions satisfying continuity or regularity conditions \u2014 and justify that restriction.\n\n2) Don\u2019t wave away infinite/pathological counterexamples \u2014 engage them with principled responses. A recurring move in the post is to dismiss Russell/Wilkinson/St. Petersburg-type objections by saying \u201cinfinities always cause problems\u201d or \u201cthese are fake.\u201d That\u2019s a large inferential gap: either you must (a) provide a principled reason to restrict decision principles to avoid those infinities (and show that this restriction doesn\u2019t also block relevant finite cases), or (b) show how a fanatical decision rule can be modified to avoid specific money-pump/divergence problems while preserving the pro-fanatic conclusions in ordinary finite cases. Actionable fixes: pick 1\u20132 of the strongest infinite objections (e.g., St. Petersburg money pumps, Russell\u2019s correlated constructions) and (i) give a formal account of why they fail (mathematical cutoffs, measurability/normalizability conditions, or an explicit decision rule that treats those gambles differently), or (ii) concede limits candidly and explain how much of your pro-fanatic practical conclusion survives under those limits.\n\n3) Strengthen the practical decision guidance and grapple with moral/epistemic uncertainty. You claim big practical consequences (donate to longtermist causes, work on AI safety, etc.), but the article lacks actionable, robust guidance under realistic uncertainty about probabilities, model misspecification, and moral uncertainty. Readers will reasonably ask: how sensitive are these prescriptions to slight changes in priors or to adopting bounded utility or probability-weighting? Actionable fixes: (i) add a short section with simple robustness checks or toy models showing how much credence in extreme outcomes is needed for fanaticism to imply longtermist action; (ii) discuss reasonable decision rules under moral uncertainty (e.g., weighted expected choice, maximin over priors, ratio/robustness criteria) and where they point; (iii) give practical heuristics (e.g., how to allocate marginal donations/career time across more certain short-term interventions vs. extreme longshot bets) so readers can act even if they\u2019re not fully convinced by the philosophical case.\n\nSummary: make the assumptions and mathematical scope explicit; engage the best infinite/pathological objections with principled responses rather than dismissal; and add concrete robustness analysis and practical decision guidance so readers can see how your normative conclusion translates into real-world action under uncertainty.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback identifies central, high-impact weaknesses: the post relies on informal moves between named principles and hand-waves away infinite/pathological counterexamples (an obvious \"own goal\" readers will seize on). Making axioms, scope, and allowed decision rules explicit, engaging the strongest infinite objections with principled restrictions or formal replies, and adding robustness/practical guidance would materially strengthen the argument and reduce embarrassing gaps. These changes are actionable and focused (pick 1\u20132 formal proofs, address the St. Petersburg/Russell-style challenges, add short robustness toy models), so they improve the post substantially without requiring indiscriminate lengthening."

    "clarity_score": 7,
    "explanation": "Strengths: The post is well structured (numbered sections), lays out multiple distinct arguments for fanaticism, uses simple parables and concrete examples early on, and supplies citations for technical claims \u2014 all of which make its overall line of thought easy to follow for the target audience. Weaknesses: It is very long and repetitious (many points are restated in different guises), which reduces accessibility; several sections (St. Petersburg / Russell technical appendix, infinities/divergent-series material) are dense and assume substantial background in decision theory/math, so a non\u2011specialist will struggle; occasional informal asides/jokes and some leaps in argumentative detail make parts less tightly argued and concise than they could be. Overall: clear and well\u2011organized for readers already familiar with expected\u2011value debates, but excessively verbose and occasionally technically heavy for casual readers."

    "explanation": "For EA Forum readers this is largely a synthesis and popular defence of an already well\u2011trodden position: it recycles and cites the main moves (partial dominance, independence/scale arguments, Indology/Russell/Wilkinson, Carlsmith, Beckstead & Thomas, St. Petersburg, Pascal\u2019s mugging, tail\u2011discounting, etc.). There\u2019s little in the way of genuinely new formal argument or surprising premises for the specialist audience. For the general educated public, however, the package is quite novel: ideas like expected\u2011value fanaticism, the detailed infinity/St. Petersburg pathologies, Indology/Russell style objections, and the nuanced responses are unfamiliar and non\u2011obvious, so the post would feel substantially new to most non\u2011specialists."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post presents a broad, well-structured set of independent arguments (partial dominance, independence/scale arguments, indology/background-independence, Carlsmith, clone/repetition arguments) and cites relevant literature. It anticipates the major objections (Pascal\u2019s mugging, St. Petersburg, money pumps, infinities) and gives substantive replies, showing intellectual engagement with the debate. Weaknesses: Many key moves rely on contestable normative axioms (unqualified transitivity, dominance/separability, negative reflection, scale independence) so the force of the conclusion depends on accepting those. The treatment of infinite cases is arguably too quick \u2014 dismissing counterexamples as \u2018mere math weirdness\u2019 is controversial and may not satisfy opponents who accept principled restrictions. Empirical evidence is sparse and mostly about human risk intuition (appropriate but limited); there is little empirical support for the practical prescriptions or for the normative premises. Overall the post gives a persuasive and sophisticated philosophical case for fanaticism, but it is not decisive: reasonable alternative responses remain, especially around how to handle infinitary cases and which axioms to reject."

    "validation_notes": "Most of the post\u2019s empirical claims and its citations to the recent philosophical literature are accurate and well-supported. Key theoretical results the author appeals to are real and published (Beckstead & Thomas\u2019s \u2018trilemma\u2019/paradox; Hayden Wilkinson\u2019s \u2018Indology\u2019/Egyptology arguments; Russell\u2019s critical replies; Carlsmith\u2019s \u2018moving people across lottery-buckets\u2019 argument), and the psychological claims about human insensitivity to very small probabilities and to scope/large-number differences are supported by empirical work (Sunstein on probability neglect; contingent\u2011valuation / Desvousges et al. evidence for scope\u2011insensitivity; later lab work on stress increasing scope insensitivity). Where the post makes normative/philosophical claims (e.g. that accepting certain axioms \u201cprovably\u201d implies fanaticism, or that alternatives must reject transitivity/independence/etc.), those are analytic results proved in the cited literature rather than empirical claims and are represented correctly. A few of the author\u2019s empirical anecdotes (e.g. particular jury/fingerprint examples) are drawn from the literature on probability neglect but would require precise references for the exact experimental numbers cited; the broader empirical generalisations about people rounding tiny probabilities toward zero and showing scope insensitivity are supported by the literature. Overall: the post is well-grounded in both the philosophical literature on fanaticism and in empirical work about human probability/scope biases, though its central position remains a philosophical/axiomatic conclusion not an empirical one.",
