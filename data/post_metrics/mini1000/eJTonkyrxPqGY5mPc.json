    "explanation": "For the EA/longtermist community this question is moderately important: whether existential catastrophes typically wipe out all animal sentience vs leaving large numbers of animals alive materially affects how much weight to give wild\u2011animal and invertebrate welfare in long\u2011term prioritization, research agendas, and funding. It is not foundational to core EA conclusions (e.g., AI alignment and reducing extinction risk remain high priorities) but it is load\u2011bearing for specific tradeoffs and niche cause selection. For general humanity the post is of low importance \u2014 interesting and ethically relevant, but unlikely to change broad public policy or survival prospects except in extreme scenarios."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Define your terms and narrow the question. Right now key phrases like \u201cexistential catastrophe\u201d, \u201cdisempower humanity\u201d, and \u201canimal sentience\u201d are used imprecisely, which invites very different interpretations and makes answers hard to compare. Before publishing, add one-sentence operational definitions (e.g. time horizon, which taxa count as sentient, whether you mean permanent sterilization vs temporary collapse). This will reduce confusion and get more useful, targeted responses. \n\n2) Replace vague intuitions with a short scenario taxonomy that maps mechanisms to likely biological outcomes. List the few concrete catastrophe types you care about (e.g. global sterilizing events, prolonged human collapse with agricultural breakdown, fast ASI that appropriates planetary energy, targeted engineered bioweapon, climate-driven ecosystem collapse) and for each give 1\u20132 sentences about the mechanism by which it would affect different taxa (large vertebrates, invertebrates, soil microbes, aquatic life). Invite readers to give probability weights per scenario rather than debating an unnamed \u201cx-risk\u201d mass. This both focuses answers and surfaces the most important empirical uncertainties. \n\n3) Anticipate and address the major counterarguments you seem to be overlooking. In particular: (a) many extinction mechanisms spare large fractions of invertebrate/soil/aquatic life (refugia, thermal tolerances, microbes) so total loss of sentience is often less likely than human extinction; (b) ASI does not necessarily mean complete appropriation of biological energy\u2014consider preservation, simulation, or partial conversion outcomes; (c) the relevant normative question may be change in total sentient welfare, not only extinction. Add a short paragraph acknowledging these points and cite a few relevant sources (e.g. Ord's The Precipice or Bostrom on x-risk; Rethink Priorities / reducing-suffering.org and the EA Forum posts you linked) so respondents can engage with specifics rather than correcting basic misunderstandings.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback targets the post's main weaknesses: imprecision of terms, lack of concrete scenario breakdown, and missing obvious counterarguments (refugia for invertebrates/microbes, alternative ASI outcomes, welfare vs extinction). Implementing these fixes would substantially improve clarity and answerability without forcing large rewrites. It doesn\u2019t claim the author is fundamentally wrong, but it corrects major omissions that would otherwise lead to off-track or unhelpful responses."

    "clarity_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The post's main question is clear and well-motivated \u2014 it asks what share of existential-risk scenarios would also eradicate non-human sentience and whether that affects prioritization \u2014 and includes useful context and links. Weaknesses: imprecise terminology and apologetic hedging, some long/repetitive sentences, and two related questions mixed together make the post slightly verbose and reduce precision. With crisper definitions (e.g., define \"existential catastrophe\", \"animal sentience\" scope) and a tighter structure it would be very clear."

    "explanation": "Among EA/longtermist readers this is a fairly familiar cluster of concerns: people have repeatedly discussed whether AI doom or other x-risks would also eliminate non\u2011human sentience, and how wild\u2011animal/invertebrate welfare factors into longtermist priorities (e.g. Brian Tomasik, Wild Animal Initiative, many Forum posts). The post isn't proposing a new mechanism or framework, just asking for probabilistic priors about how often survivors would include sentient animals. To a general educated audience, however, the specific distinction \u2014 that many x\u2011risk scenarios might leave nonhuman sentience intact (or conversely wipe it out via ASI resource takeover) and the implications for valuing x\u2011risk reduction \u2014 is less commonly considered, so it is moderately novel to that audience."

    "explanation": "The post poses a sensible and important question and honestly acknowledges uncertainty, which is a strength. However, it is informal and imprecise about key terms (e.g. \"existential catastrophe\", \"animal sentience\", what counts as 'wiping out'), conflates different scenario types (disempowerment vs extinction vs ASI energy takeover), and does not lay out a structured argument or mechanism-by-mechanism reasoning for why animal sentience would or would not survive various classes of x-risk. Empirical evidence is essentially absent \u2014 no data, modeling, or literature is cited to assess probabilities, ecological resilience, refugia, or mechanisms of species survival/extinction \u2014 beyond links to related blog/forum posts. Overall the post is a useful prompt for discussion but provides only weak support for any substantive claim about how often x-risk scenarios would eliminate all animal sentience."

    "validation_notes": "Mixed/uncertain. Key empirical points in the post are partly supported but important claims are speculative. Reliable sources and expert surveys (T. Ord; Grace et al. 2024) back the poster\u2019s broad claim that anthropogenic existential risks\u2014especially unaligned advanced AI\u2014are considered non-negligible over the next centuries. EA discussions and literature also treat natural/cosmic risks as relatively unlikely in the near term. However, the specific claim that \u201cmost plausible human\u2011extinction scenarios will also wipe out all non\u2011human sentience\u201d is not well supported by empirical evidence: it is a contested, scenario\u2011dependent judgment. Philosophical/technical arguments (Bostrom\u2019s instrumental\u2011convergence / paperclip thought experiments) show how a misaligned superintelligence could appropriate resources and threaten biospheric life, but there is no consensus or quantitative evidence that this outcome is the modal outcome of existential catastrophe. EA Forum posts and papers explicitly examine multiple plausible post\u2011x\u2011risk outcomes (animals surviving, being displaced, or being exterminated), showing genuine epistemic uncertainty rather than a clear predominance of \u201ctotal animal extinction\u201d scenarios. Because the most important claims are speculative and contested rather than empirically established, a middle score is appropriate.",
