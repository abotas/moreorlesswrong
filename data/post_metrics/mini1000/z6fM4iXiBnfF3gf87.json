    "explanation": "This is primarily an organisational update about leadership transition at a small-but-relevant EA-aligned charity. It matters to Hi\u2011Med staff, volunteers, donors, and prospective applicants (affecting hiring, continuity, and short-term strategy), and is useful context for those tracking EA medical interventions and grantee stability. However, it is not a foundational argument or evidence-changing piece for EA theory or strategy more broadly, and has negligible importance for general humanity beyond Hi\u2011Med\u2019s direct beneficiaries and supporters."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Clarify governance and conflict-of-interest safeguards around you joining the governing board. Readers will spot the potential problem of the outgoing Executive Director becoming a board member (especially if you had influence over the hiring process). State explicitly whether you will: (a) participate in or recuse from the ED hiring process, (b) have voting power on matters that could affect the new ED, and (c) what safeguards the board will use to preserve independence (e.g., recusal policy, temporary non-voting status, independent chair). This avoids perceptions that the ED transition is controlled by the prior ED.\n\n2) Add concrete handover / continuity details. The post omits who will run day-to-day operations between now and the new ED, and what the immediate transition plan looks like. Candidates, donors, and partners care about organisational stability. Say who is the interim lead (or if you\u2019ll cover handover responsibilities), what critical projects are paused/continuing, the expected timeline for handover, and what support (board / funder / staff) the incoming ED will receive. If there isn\u2019t a full plan yet, say that and give a date for when you\u2019ll publish it.\n\n3) Back up impact claims with a short, punchy set of metrics or a one-page evidence summary. Statements like \u201cimpact-to-date document is over 100 pages\u201d and citing Open Phil are useful but weak for readers who want quick evidence. Include 3\u20135 headline metrics (e.g., number of clinicians trained, retention rates, measurable downstream outcomes, any RCTs or external evaluations, and funding runway) and link to the specific evaluation or theory-of-change summary. This reassures prospective applicants, funders, and community members without greatly increasing post length.",
    "improvement_potential": "The three points target real, non-trivial omissions that could undermine credibility with candidates, donors, and the EA community: potential COI from the outgoing ED joining the board, lack of interim/transition clarity, and unsupported impact claims. Each fix is high-value and can be implemented succinctly (recusal statement, named interim lead or timeline, 3\u20135 headline metrics + link). These are not nitpicks and address plausible 'own goals' readers would flag, so the feedback is highly useful though not absolutely critical to the post's basic message."

The handle does not appear among prominent EA Forum/LessWrong contributors or public EA figures; it may be a pseudonym or a minor/unknown contributor. If you can share links or more context (posts, publications, platform), I can reassess."

    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The post is well-structured and easy to follow: a concise summary up front, clear chronology (before/during/decision/next steps), and an unambiguous announcement of stepping down with reasons and practical follow-up information. Weaknesses are mainly verbosity in the 'During the role' acknowledgements (many names/links make scanning harder), a few long/dense sentences, and minor awkward phrasing (e.g. 'donate more again') that could be tightened for greater concision."

    "explanation": "This is primarily a personal/organisational update (stepping down, thanking colleagues, reasons for leaving, and a job advert). EA readers frequently see similar role-change and handover posts, and it doesn\u2019t introduce new arguments, theories, or novel interventions. To the general public it\u2019s a very common career announcement with little that\u2019s original."

    "explanation": "This is primarily a personal announcement rather than an argumentative paper, and the reasoning about why the author is stepping down is clear, internally consistent, and transparent about trade-offs (complete residency for career resilience, enable greater donations, preserve part\u2011time charity involvement). The post cites credible external validations (an academic paper on the initial fellowship cohort and an Open Philanthropy grant recommendation) and links to impact materials and job listings, which supports claims of organisational stability. However, empirical evidence for Hi\u2011Med\u2019s overall impact is limited in the post (mostly anecdotes, qualitative case studies, and references rather than summarized quantitative outcomes), and some causal claims (e.g., the necessity of the Open Phil grant for most positive impact) are asserted rather than demonstrated. Overall the decision is well explained and plausibly justified, but the empirical support for broader impact claims is moderate rather than strong."

    "validation_notes": "Most major empirical claims in the post are well supported by independent sources. Open Philanthropy\u2019s grant recommendation to High Impact Medicine (July 2024, $321,338) is confirmed; the PLOS ONE paper about Hi\u2011Med\u2019s inaugural fellowship cohort exists (PMC/PLOS ONE) and matches the outcomes described; Hi\u2011Med\u2019s website documents the organisation\u2019s programmes (intro fellowship, podcast, conferences) and links to the \u2018current opportunities\u2019 document. The EA Forum post itself (author Marie Firgau) matches the quoted text. Minor limitations: several statements are personal/self\u2011reported (e.g. exact start date and duration of full\u2011time employment, personal residency years, donation behaviour) which are plausible but rely primarily on the author; I could not open the Google Docs job description in my browsing session due to rendering restrictions, though the Hi\u2011Med site and the EA Forum post link to it and the Forum post states the 26 Jan 2025 deadline. The Hi\u2011Med team page now lists a new Executive Director (Simon Ling), which is consistent with the post\u2019s announcement that leadership would transition. Overall, empirical claims are well supported with only a few claims that are necessarily self\u2011reported or where the original Google Doc could not be directly rendered in my session.",
