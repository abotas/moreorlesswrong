    "explanation": "This is an important, action-relevant critique for the EA community because it challenges how Effective Giving Initiatives measure their impact and could materially change fundraising recommendations and donor behaviour if the large animal-vs-human cost-effectiveness gaps are real. It isn\u2019t fully foundational (its conclusions rest on contested empirical estimates and normative assumptions about cross-species value), but it is load-bearing for practical cause prioritisation, EGI design, and funder incentives. For general humanity the post is of modest importance: if true it could shift philanthropic flows at scale and improve billions of animals\u2019 welfare, but it\u2019s mainly a specialised meta-level argument about EA processes rather than a direct policy or public-health claim affecting most people."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Heavy reliance on large point-estimates without addressing uncertainty, marginality, or comparability \u2014 The post cites very large multipliers (e.g. 168x, 64k\u00d7) as if they\u2019re directly comparable across cause areas. But those numbers are typically highly uncertain, sensitive to modelling choices, and often measure different things (average vs marginal impact, short- vs long-run effects, point estimates without credible intervals). Actionable fixes: (a) explicitly state the uncertainty and give ranges or confidence intervals where possible; (b) distinguish average vs marginal cost\u2011effectiveness and discuss diminishing returns / scalability (can animal-welfare interventions scale to absorb large marginal donations at the same ratio?); and (c) discuss donor substitution and counterfactuals (would the donor have given to animal welfare anyway?) and how that affects the multiplier logic. Even a short appendix or a single paragraph adding these caveats will greatly strengthen the claim.\n\n2) Inappropriate recommendation to use DALYs (or other single human-centric metrics) for cross-domain comparison \u2014 Recommending EGIs track DALYs averted per dollar is misleading because DALYs measure human health and aren\u2019t directly applicable to animal suffering or wild-animal welfare. That risks encouraging spurious comparisons or hiding crucial normative assumptions about how to value animal welfare vs human welfare. Actionable fixes: (a) scrap the direct DALY recommendation or reframe it: recommend EGIs use a set of comparable metrics and state the conversion assumptions transparently (e.g., human DALYs alongside animal-suffering-adjusted units, or welfare-adjusted expected-utility estimates with clear parameters); (b) propose a concrete, tractable alternative (e.g., report expected welfare-impact per $ under 2\u20133 clearly-specified value-aggregation assumptions, plus sensitivity analysis) so readers can see how robust the cross-cause ranking is to different valuation choices.\n\n3) Overstated claims about incentives/funder control without evidence \u2014 The post asserts EGIs\u2019 cause prioritisation is \u201cultimately restricted\u201d by Moskovitz/Tuna \u2192 Open Phil \u2192 EGIs, which is a strong structural claim that needs backing. As written, this risks undercutting credibility and distracts from the analytic point about measurement and incentives. Actionable fixes: (a) either provide concrete evidence (funding relationships, grant conditions, governance documents) that funders are directly shaping EGIs\u2019 KPI choices, or (b) soften the claim into a recommendation to funders and EGIs about incentive design (e.g., suggest specific evaluation criteria funders could ask for: marginal impact estimates, cross-cause sensitivity analyses, or impact-per-dollar rather than donation multipliers). That keeps the policy-relevant point while avoiding an unsubstantiated institutional claim.\n\nImplementing these three changes (add uncertainty/marginal analysis, replace DALY suggestion with a robust multi-metric approach, and remove/soften unsupported funding-structure claims) will make the post far more defensible and useful for EGIs and funders without substantially increasing length.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback hits the post's three biggest weaknesses: treating huge point estimates as directly comparable (no uncertainty, marginality, or counterfactuals), recommending DALYs for cross-domain comparisons without addressing normative conversion issues, and making a strong institutional claim about funder control without evidence. Each point is actionable, concise, and would materially strengthen the post without undue lengthening. Missing minor critiques (e.g., explicit discussion of normative assumptions about animal vs human moral weights) don\u2019t outweigh the high value of the three identified fixes."

    "explanation": "Overall the post is clear and logically structured for an EA\u2011savvy audience: it states a central claim, explains why EGIs' donation\u2011multiplier metric can mislead across cause areas, and supplies concrete (linked) estimates and recommendations. Strengths: clear thesis, supported examples, actionable suggestions. Weaknesses: heavy use of acronyms/jargon (though linked), a somewhat awkward/title phrasing, and very large multiplier claims that are not fully unpacked here (methodological assumptions could be more explicit). The post is a bit long and link\u2011dense and could be made more concise by summarising key figures and assumptions up front."

    "explanation": "For EA Forum readers the core pieces are familiar: large inter-cause cost\u2011effectiveness differences (especially animal vs. human welfare), debates about where EGIs should steer donors, and the specific high CE estimates for broiler/shrimp/pesticide interventions have been discussed on the Forum. What is moderately novel for this audience is the explicit critique of the common EGI metric (donation\u2011multiplier) as potentially misleading across cause areas and the concrete recommendation that EGIs measure impact in direct outcome terms (e.g. DALYs or comparable metrics) to avoid cross\u2011cause misallocation. For the general public these points are substantially more novel: most people are unlikely to have considered that charity recommendation platforms might be biased by measuring only donations rather than real outcomes, or that certain animal\u2011welfare interventions could be orders of magnitude more cost\u2011effective than leading human\u2011welfare charities. The post\u2019s strongest novel elements are (a) the framing that donation multipliers can distort cross\u2011cause comparisons, and (b) the specific, large numerical CE differences claimed for certain animal interventions; the rest (cause prioritisation, funder influence worries) is less original."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post makes a clear, logically coherent point \u2014 that EGIs which measure success only by donation multipliers may mis-prioritize across cause areas if the marginal cost-effectiveness of recommended charities differs greatly between areas (e.g., animal vs. human welfare). It reasonably recommends that EGIs should be deliberate about cross-cause comparisons and consider impact measures beyond donation multipliers.\n\nWeaknesses: The empirical case rests mainly on very large cost-effectiveness ratios taken from a handful of forum posts and back-of-envelope estimates (broiler/cage-free, shrimp project, pesticides) that are highly assumption-sensitive and lack robustness checks, uncertainty ranges, or independent validation. The post does not engage with key counterarguments (moral weighting differences across species, comparability problems between DALYs and animal welfare metrics, donor behavior constraints, attribution and scalability issues, or the uncertainty/fragility of the estimates). It also offers little direct evidence about how EGIs actually behave in practice or whether funder incentives operate as claimed. Because the substantive numerical claims are both central and highly uncertain, the overall support for the strong takeaway is limited."

The post\u2019s descriptive claims about how many Effective Giving Initiatives (EGIs) measure impact as a \u2018giving multiplier\u2019 (additional donations caused per $ spent) are well-supported by public documentation (e.g., Giving What We Can impact evaluations, Ambitious Impact program materials, and ACE / FarmKind transparency). Open Philanthropy\u2019s role as a major funder (and its main funders Dustin Moskovitz and Cari Tuna) is also documented. However, the large numerical claims (broiler/cage\u2011free = 168x / 462x; SWP = 64.3k\u00d7; humane\u2011pesticide = 23.7k\u00d7 vs GiveWell top charities) come from the author\u2019s own Fermi\u2011style EA Forum analyses and rely on many highly uncertain assumptions and conversions (DALY proxies, pain\u2011intensity weightings, long time horizons). Those numerical multipliers are therefore not independently validated by external peer\u2011reviewed or mainstream empirical sources and should be treated as speculative, with orders\u2011of\u2011magnitude uncertainty acknowledged in the underlying posts.",
