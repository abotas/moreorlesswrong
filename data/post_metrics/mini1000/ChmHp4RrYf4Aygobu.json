    "explanation": "This post is practically useful for the EA community because it concerns outreach and improving how a large donor bloc (churchgoers/Christians) evaluates charities \u2014 work that could redirect substantial philanthropic dollars toward higher-impact causes. It isn't foundational to EA's core theories (e.g., longtermist arguments or AI risk), so it's moderate rather than high importance. For general humanity the impact is smaller: better charity evaluation among Christians could improve allocation of billions in giving, but it is unlikely to change large-scale global trajectories or existential risks, so its importance is minor-to-moderate."

    "explanation": "No evidence (up to my 2024-06 knowledge cutoff) that 'James-Hartree-Law' is a recognized figure in the EA/rationalist community or publicly: not a visible poster on EA Forum/LessWrong, not a known speaker/author, and not indexed in major academic or media sources. Likely a pseudonym or a very minor/obscure online handle. If you can share links or context, I can re-evaluate."

  "PostClarity": {
    "post_id": "ChmHp4RrYf4Aygobu",
    "clarity_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The post is overall clear and direct: it asks for recommended readings on charity-evaluation methodology, whether a unified method exists, and for contacts to discuss evaluation\u2014with a specific interest in reaching Christians and four brief reasons why this matters. Strengths: concise questions, focused topic, and concrete motivation. Weaknesses: informal tone and a typo ('reccomended'), a vague estimate ($13B) with no source or method, and some ambiguity about what level or type of 'methodology' the asker means (academic, practical, metrics, etc.). A bit more structure, sourcing for the estimate, and clarity about the desired depth of readings would improve it."

    "novelty_humanity": 4,
    "explanation": "Asking for primers on charity evaluation and whether a unified methodology exists is a very common/topic in EA circles \u2014 GiveWell, Open Phil, IDinsight, 80,000 Hours etc. have well-known approaches \u2014 so this is low-novelty for EA readers. The slightly more original element is the explicit focus on reaching Christian donors (and the rough $13B estimate / claims about centralization and underexposure), which is a specific outreach angle many EAs may not have prioritized. For the general educated public, charity evaluation is somewhat familiar but the EA-style methodology and the targeted strategy toward churchgiving are moderately novel, though not highly original."

    "evidence_quality": 2,
    "overall_support": 3,
    "explanation": "The post raises sensible questions and a plausible agenda (learning charity-eval methods and engaging Christians), but its argument is informal and underdeveloped. Key claims (80% of churchgoers give to non-profits, $13B spent by US churches, high centralization, EA messaging not landing) are asserted without sources or definitions, causal links are assumed rather than argued, and there is no engagement with existing literature or frameworks. As a result the reasoning is partly coherent but incomplete, and the empirical support is weak and insufficient to substantiate the main thesis."

    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 5,
    "validation_notes": "Mixed / uncertain. Some of the poster\u2019s empirical intuitions are supported but several numeric claims are overstated or ambiguous. Evidence shows a large majority of regular churchgoers give beyond their local congregation (Lifeway surveys report ~73% give to at least one charity beyond their church), which is directionally consistent with the poster\u2019s point but lower than the claimed 80%. Religious organizations remain the single largest recipient sector nationally (Giving USA: ~24% of U.S. charitable dollars in recent years), but religious giving\u2019s share has fallen over decades and donors increasingly channel gifts outside traditional congregational offerings (so the poster\u2019s phrase \u201chighly centralised\u201d is vague and not well supported \u2014 historically more centralized, but now less so). Scholarship on congregational finances (National Congregations Study / Mark Chaves et al.) finds that only a minority of congregational budgets are spent directly on social-service programs (median direct outlays are small; conservative estimates put congregational spending benefitting nonmembers in a wide range roughly 2%\u2013~15\u201330% depending on method), so the poster\u2019s $13B estimate for \u201cUSA churches spend\u201d on charity is plausible as an order-of-magnitude guess but highly sensitive to assumptions and not directly supported by a single authoritative figure. Finally, peer-reviewed work on effective-altruism psychology and giving motivations documents limited awareness of evidence-based/effectiveness frameworks among typical donors and motivational biases toward familiar/in-group causes \u2014 this supports the poster\u2019s claim that many Christians may be underexposed to EA-style effectiveness arguments. Overall: directional claims are often supported, point estimates (80%, $13B, \u201chighly centralised\u201d) are either slightly off, ambiguous, or lack a robust single-source foundation.",

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Be more specific about what you mean by \u201cmethods of charity evaluation\u201d and what you want from readers. Do you want primers on cost-effectiveness, outcome measurement, counterfactuals/attribution, or organisational due diligence? State the exact topics you want recommended readings for and the level (intro, technical, practitioner). This will avoid vague answers and attract people with the right expertise.  \n\n2) Back up or remove big quantitative and categorical claims. Your key claims (\"80% of churchgoers give...,\" \"Christian giving is highly centralised,\" \"USA churches spend $13B\") are consequential to how people will respond. Either cite sources or explain your estimation method, or drop the numbers and replace them with a qualitative statement. Without evidence these look like unsupported assumptions and will reduce credibility.  \n\n3) Acknowledge existing work and the sensitivity of outreach to religious communities, and clarify your goal. Briefly note that there are existing charity-eval authorities (GiveWell, CEA, Founders Pledge, charity evaluation frameworks) and that effective engagement with Christians often requires faith-aligned framing. Say whether you want: (a) resources to learn evaluation methods, (b) introductions to people who do faith-focused outreach, or (c) advice on messaging for Christian audiences. This prevents readers from answering the wrong question and signals you\u2019ve considered likely counterarguments (e.g., that religious donors use different decision criteria or prioritise institutional autonomy).",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback hits the post's main weaknesses: it's vague about what 'methods' are wanted, it makes strong unsupported quantitative claims, and it doesn't state whether the OP wants resources, introductions, or messaging help. The suggestions are concrete and actionable and wouldn't notably lengthen the post. It could be improved slightly by also advising the OP to define geographic/scope terms (e.g., US vs global, 'churchgoers' vs denominations) and to soften/clarify phrasing about outreach failures, but overall the feedback identifies the major own-goals and fixes that would materially improve the post."
