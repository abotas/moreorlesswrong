    "explanation": "This is a personal, anecdotal pledge rather than an evidence-based argument or new idea. For the EA community it is mildly interesting: it signals extreme commitment, could inspire discussion about norms, obligations, and the costs of longtermist/altruistic lifestyles, and might matter a little for recruiting or culture. It is not load-bearing for EA theory or policy and has limited practical implications. For general humanity it is largely trivial \u2014 a touching personal intention but not something that meaningfully changes outcomes or broad decisions (aside from modest inspirational value or the potential harm of promoting unhealthy self-sacrifice)."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Missing practical and sustainability considerations (big personal-risk/credibility hole). You treat \u201cdonate everything\u201d as a pure virtue without discussing foreseeable harms: burnout, mental-health decline, social isolation, illness, family responsibilities, and dynamic inconsistency (you might change your mind). Before publishing, either acknowledge these tradeoffs or ask explicitly for advice about them. Actionable fix: add a short paragraph that (a) defines what you mean by \u201ceverything\u201d (all income? all assets? after-tax?), (b) asks for experiences or frameworks for sustainable extreme earning-to-give (e.g. limits people set to avoid burnout), and (c) invites resources on mental-health and long-term planning for high-donation lifestyles.\\n\\n2) Overlooks legal/financial and impact-planning details that readers will expect. There are straightforward practicalities (taxes, donation vehicles, estate issues, charity selection and marginal impact, donor-advised funds/trusts) that make \u201cdonate everything\u201d nontrivial and could make donations less effective if ignored. Actionable fix: either say you\u2019ve researched these areas or add specific questions (e.g., \u201chow do people structure large give-away plans to minimize tax inefficiency?\u201d \u201cwhat fraction of income do extreme earners realistically donate?\u201d). Point readers to concrete next steps you\u2019ll take (simulate finances, read Giving What We Can/80,000 Hours, look into DAFs and legal counsel).\\n\\n3) Weak post purpose and call-to-action \u2014 hard ask, unlikely to generate useful replies. You ask if anyone will \u201cdonate everything\u201d but give no definition, timeline, or reasoned invitation for help. Actionable fix: tighten the ask to get usable replies: e.g., \u201cI\u2019m 14, planning to pursue X career and aim to give Y% of income; does anyone have first-hand experience doing extreme earning-to-give or living minimally while working high hours? What resources/pledges helped you?\u201d Also offer safe ways for people to share private experiences (anonymized anecdotes, links to public posts) and invite mentorship or suggested reading. These edits will make responses more practical and reduce people replying only to criticize naivety.",
    "improvement_potential": "Addresses major omissions the author made (undefined terms, sustainability/burnout risks, legal/financial mechanics, and a weak ask). The suggestions are actionable and would materially improve the post\u2019s clarity and usefulness without requiring a long rewrite. It could be slightly more empathetic to the author\u2019s age/intent, but overall it catches the key mistakes that would undermine productive responses."

    "explanation": "The post is easy to understand and the writer's intent is clear \u2014 a 14-year-old plans to live extremely frugally and give away essentially all future earnings and is asking whether others have done or plan to do the same. Strengths: straightforward phrasing, clear request, and consistent theme. Weaknesses: some repetition (e.g., restating anonymity and anticipated unhappiness), and key terms are vague (what exactly 'donating everything' means, timeline, or tradeoffs), so it could be more concise and precise."

    "explanation": "For EA readers the core idea\u2014earn-to-give and extreme frugality to maximize charity\u2014is well known (many have discussed 100% pledges, austere lifestyles, and earn-to-give careers), so this post is not very novel though the personal details (camper van, 14-hour days, donating literally everything) are a somewhat extreme instantiation. For the general public it is more unusual: lifelong total donation is uncommon and evokes ascetic or saintly examples, but the basic concept of giving nearly all income away and living extremely simply is not a radically original idea."

    "overall_support": 2,
    "explanation": "The post is honest and shows some awareness of trade-offs (anticipated unhappiness, social costs), but it presents no structured argument for why donating everything is feasible, morally required, or the best strategy compared to more moderate options. Empirical support is essentially absent \u2014 just an anecdotal internet search and personal intention \u2014 with no data, case studies, legal/tax considerations, or references to relevant literature. Overall the claim is plausible as a personal plan but is very weakly supported if treated as a general recommendation or thesis."

    "validation_notes": "Most of the post is personal intention (not independently verifiable). However the key empirical claim \u2014 \u201cI have not found a single person who has ever donated everything\u201d \u2014 is false. Multiple well-documented individuals have given away essentially all or the vast majority of their wealth (e.g., Chuck Feeney donated roughly his entire fortune via Atlantic Philanthropies; Zell Kravinsky gave away ~$45M; Sir Henry Wellcome vested his company to a trust that became the Wellcome Trust). Many wealthy people also pledge to give away most of their wealth (Giving Pledge). Thus the author\u2019s negative claim is contradicted by reliable sources; rating 3 because personal plans are non\u2011verifiable but the central empirical claim is significantly inaccurate.",
