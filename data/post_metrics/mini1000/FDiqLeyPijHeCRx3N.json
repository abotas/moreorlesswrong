    "explanation": "This post raises a practice-level question that matters for how EA institutions evaluate and recommend charities: whether evaluators should meaningfully assess secondary values (culture, political effects, movement health) in addition to target-effectiveness. If taken seriously, it could change evaluator norms, donor behaviour, grant flows, and movement reputation \u2014 modestly load-bearing for EA decision-making and institutional design, and useful for governance and trust. It is not foundational to EA\u2019s core cause-prioritization (e.g., AI/x-risk or global health models), so it\u2019s important but not critical. For general humanity the impact is limited \u2014 it mainly affects donors, charities, and movement insiders rather than broad societal outcomes."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Missing empirical support and opportunity-cost analysis \u2014 The post asserts evaluators should \"finish the job\" by assessing non-core values but doesn\u2019t show this is practical or that it improves donor decisions. Action: add concrete evidence or case studies where secondary-value issues changed outcomes (positive or negative), or at minimum include an explicit opportunity-cost calculation (how much researcher time would be spent, what would be dropped, and a simple cost\u2013benefit threshold). If evidence is thin, frame the recommendation as a hypothesis and propose a pilot study (e.g., assess 5 top charities for 2 extra values and measure whether donors change behavior).\n\n2) Overlooks major counterarguments and harms from mission creep/politicization \u2014 The post doesn\u2019t grapple with plausible and important downsides: evaluators imposing their own political or moral views, reputational risk to charities, reduced comparability across causes, and incentives toward capture or weaponization of evaluations. Action: explicitly address these counterarguments and propose concrete mitigations (e.g., separate and labeled modules for \u201ccore-effectiveness\u201d vs \u201cvalue-alignment,\u201d transparent methodology, appeal/review process for charities, and safeguards against political bias such as diverse reviewer panels and funding firewalls).\n\n3) Unclear scope and no operationalizable framework \u2014 Much of the piece is high-level. Readers need clearer definitions and an actionable model for how evaluators should incorporate extra-value assessments. Action: tighten the taxonomy (distinguish evaluators vs grantmakers vs recommender services), recommend a feasible minimum standard (e.g., always publish a short \"secondary-values checklist\" for top picks), and give a prioritized, pragmatic rollout (which values to test first, how to present results to donors\u2014separate scores, configurable weighting, or narrative warnings). This will make the argument both more persuasive and more publishable.",
    "improvement_potential": "The three points target genuine, high-impact gaps in the draft: lack of empirical/opportunity-cost analysis, failure to engage strong counterarguments (mission creep, politicization, capture), and vagueness about operational scope. Fixing these would materially strengthen the argument and reduce the risk the author looks naively optimistic. The suggestions are actionable (add case studies/pilot, propose mitigations, supply a concrete checklist/rollout) and would not require overturning the core thesis \u2014 just tightening and grounding it \u2014 so they offer substantial improvement without being gratuitously long."

    "explanation": "Overall the post is readable and its central claim \u2014 that EA evaluators should \u201cfinish the job\u201d by assessing how top charities score on a broader set of values beyond their primary focus \u2014 comes through clearly. Strengths: a clear thesis, a helpful ranked list of possible evaluator models, and concrete examples (ACE/Hypatia, Charity Navigator) that ground the argument. Weaknesses: a long, meandering introduction and several hedged or repetitive passages make the piece wordy and occasionally diffuse; some sentences are convoluted and could be tightened for precision; the argument would be more compelling with clearer definitions of key terms (e.g., what counts as a relevant value) and more concrete evidence or examples of tradeoffs. With trimming and a sharper roadmap up front the post would be much stronger."

    "novelty_humanity": 3,
    "explanation": "The post brings together familiar threads rather than introducing a radically new idea. EA readers will recognise the ACE/Hypatia debate, prior discussion of organizational culture, and calls for more pluralistic valuation; the most novel bits are the clear framing (\u201cfinish the job\u201d) and the concrete taxonomy of evaluator designs (1\u20136) and the explicit proposal that evaluators systematically assess top picks for other values or that a meta\u2011evaluator aggregate value\u2011specific ratings. For a general audience the core claim \u2014 evaluators should report on multiple relevant impacts so donors can choose \u2014 is commonplace in charity/accountability debates, though the EA\u2011specific framing and taxonomy add modest originality."

    "overall_support": 4,
    "explanation": "The post sets out a clear, coherent argument and useful conceptual distinctions (a taxonomy of evaluator approaches), and it acknowledges some counterarguments. However the chain of reasoning relies on several unstated or under-argued assumptions (evaluators have the capacity, legitimacy, and impartiality to judge \"other\" values; aggregated evaluations would be net beneficial; trade-offs like mission creep and political bias are manageable). Empirical support is thin: the author mainly uses anecdotes, forum posts, and examples rather than data or case studies showing that broader evaluation reliably predicts harms or improves donor outcomes. Overall the idea is plausible and worth further investigation, but currently weakly supported by evidence and incomplete on feasibility and risk analysis."

    "validation_notes": "Most of the post\u2019s concrete empirical claims are accurate and verifiable. Key factual points \u2014 that (a) community criticism of ACE\u2019s social\u2011justice\u2013related actions appeared on the EA Forum (including posts by the user \u201cHypatia\u201d and other critical threads), (b) ACE has, in practice, considered leadership/culture/DEI in its charity reviews and movement\u2011granting, (c) ACE withdrew staff from a CARE conference in 2020 and publicly justified that withdrawal, (d) ACE funded racial\u2011equity\u2013focused projects (e.g., Encompass) via Movement Grants, (e) ACE downgraded Anima International from Top to Standout in Nov 2020, and (f) Leah Edgerton (then at ACE) discussed DEI and evaluation tradeoffs in an interview with Spencer Greenberg \u2014 are all supported by primary sources. \n\nWeaknesses / caveats: some statements in the post are interpretive or subjective (e.g., \u201cthe debate has cooled and no one has changed their minds very much\u201d), which can\u2019t be strictly verified and depend on how one samples forum activity and participants; the author\u2019s characterization of ACE as being \u201cin an uncomfortable middle ground between the 4th and 5th best option\u201d is normative rather than empirical. Overall, the empirical backbone of the post is well supported by ACE\u2019s own documents and by forum posts and interviews documenting the controversy and ACE\u2019s methods.",
