    "explanation": "This claim is relatively important for the EA/rationalist community because it would materially affect prioritization of global poverty work, geographic targeting, funding allocation, and program design (e.g., family planning, health, economic development in Africa). If true, it changes where marginal dollars and research have the most impact; if false or overstated, following it could distort priorities. It is less foundational for longtermist concerns like AI safety, so it is not existential but is load-bearing for near\u2011term cause selection. For general humanity the post is of moderate importance: it highlights a major distributional and policy challenge that would affect billions, migration, geopolitics, and development planning, but it is not a civilizational or existential issue. The exact impact depends heavily on the underlying data, drivers (population growth vs. per\u2011capita stagnation), and uncertainty in the projections."

    "explanation": "I find no evidence that 'Daniel Abiliba' is a known figure in the EA/rationalist community or in wider public discourse up to my 2024-06 cutoff. The name does not appear in major EA forums, publication lists, or prominent media/academic sources I have access to; it may be a pseudonym, a very new/obscure author, or an individual with only a minimal online footprint."

  "PostClarity": {
    "post_id": "NYvfhT5k4dyxACZYE",
    "clarity_score": 4,
    "explanation": "The post states a striking claim succinctly, but is undermined by grammatical errors (\"Supposed\", lowercase \"africans\"), lack of context (what trends, definition/source of \"poor\", assumptions), and no caption or summary of the linked chart. A reader can grasp the headline claim quickly but would need to click and interpret the image and seek sources to evaluate it; the post is therefore somewhat unclear and insufficiently supported."

    "explanation": "This claim is not new: governments, NGOs and development economists (e.g. World Bank, Brookings, ODI and related reports) have been warning for years that extreme poverty will become increasingly concentrated in sub\u2011Saharan Africa and have published similar 2030 projections (often >70\u201390% of the world\u2019s poor). EA Forum readers and longtermist/development-focused audiences will almost certainly have seen this argument and the underlying data, so it\u2019s low novelty for that group. It may be somewhat more striking to a general lay audience unfamiliar with development forecasts, but the core idea and projections are already widely disseminated, and the post offers no clearly original mechanism or evidence."

    "explanation": "The claim has a plausible intuition (because poverty has fallen faster outside Africa while African population growth is high, Africa\u2019s share of global poor could rise), but the post presents only a single unreferenced projection/image and no methodology or definitions. Reasoning appears to be a simple trend extrapolation without addressing key uncertainties (poverty line/PPP choice, data sources, model, heterogeneity across countries, effects of shocks or policy changes, migration, demographic assumptions). Evidence is weak: no citations, no data, no sensitivity or scenario analysis, and no discussion of measurement issues. To be convincing it would need clear data sources, methods for the projection, scenario modelling, and engagement with alternative explanations and uncertainties."

    "validation_notes": "The claim \u2014 that Africans will constitute >80% of the world\u2019s (extreme) poor by 2030 if current trends continue \u2014 is well supported by multiple reputable analyses. World Bank publications and related research (Brookings, ODI, Save the Children) have repeatedly projected that the global extreme poor will become heavily concentrated in Sub\u2011Saharan Africa by 2030, with published scenario estimates commonly in the ~80\u201390% range. Key caveats: (1) most official projections refer specifically to Sub\u2011Saharan Africa (not the whole African continent); (2) results depend on the poverty threshold used (historical $1.90 vs later $2.15 or revised $3.00 PPP lines) and on scenario assumptions about growth, conflict, and policy; and (3) more recent updates (post\u20112019, including 2024\u20132025 World Bank work) revise baseline poverty levels and mortality of projections but continue to show a very large (>~75%) concentration of extreme poverty in Sub\u2011Saharan Africa by 2030. Given those caveats the post\u2019s headline numeric claim is broadly accurate but should be stated more precisely (specify region = Sub\u2011Saharan Africa, and the poverty threshold/scenario).",

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Show your data, definitions, and method. The claim \u201c>80% of the world\u2019s poor by 2030\u201d is a projection \u2014 say what you mean by \u201cpoor\u201d (e.g. $1.90/day PPP or another line), cite the data source(s) and either (a) show the calculation used to get 80% or (b) link to a reputable projection (World Bank, PovcalNet/OWID, Brookings, CEA). Without that, the figure reads like an assertion. \n\n2) Explicitly state and test your key assumptions. \u201cIf trends continue\u201d could mean many things (population growth, per\u2011capita GDP growth, inequality, climate shocks, policy changes). List the specific trend(s) you assume, justify them briefly, and add at least one alternative scenario (e.g. faster African growth, reduced inequality, or global shocks) or a sensitivity note. Also avoid treating \u201cAfrica\u201d as homogeneous \u2014 note major cross\u2011country heterogeneity or limit the claim to regions/countries if appropriate. \n\n3) Improve clarity and attribution of the figure and text. Fix small errors (typos, capitalization), add a caption/source for the image, and write a one\u2011sentence explanation of what the chart shows (axes, units, baseline). Shortening the claim into a precise, sourced sentence will increase credibility and reduce chances of being dismissed as alarmist.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback pinpoints major, credibility-killing omissions: no poverty definition, no data source or projection method, no explicit assumptions (e.g. which trends continue), and an unlabeled figure. Fixing these would materially improve trustworthiness and avoid obvious 'own goals' without much extra length. It stops short of claiming the thesis is impossible, so not a 10."
