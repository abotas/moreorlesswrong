    "value_humanity": 1,
    "explanation": "This is a personal funding request rather than a novel argument or analysis. It has modest relevance to the EA community because helping a promising researcher attend could slightly increase project impact and network connections, but its broader implications are speculative and not foundational to EA or global priorities. For general humanity it is essentially trivial unless it somehow enables a major breakthrough, which is unlikely and uncertain."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) No concrete ask or timeline \u2014 You haven't stated how much money you need, in what currency, and by when. Donors and grantmakers almost always need a clear budget breakdown (conference fee, flights, accommodation, visa fees, and any contingency) and a deadline for when funds are required for visa processing. Add exact numbers and dates before posting.\n\n2) Missing deliverables & impact case for funders \u2014 The post explains why EA Global matters to you, but doesn't say what funders will get in return or how you'll convert attendance into measurable impact. Spell out concrete deliverables (e.g., run a session or poster, 1:1 meetings with X type of partners, a post-conference report, follow-up workshops in Nigeria, hiring/intake goals) and simple success metrics. This makes it easier for donors to judge ROI.\n\n3) No signal of prior attempts or flexibility \u2014 You don\u2019t say which other routes you\u2019ve tried (appealing the scholarship, local EA groups, employer support, university grants, crowdfunding, EA Funds, waitlists), or whether you\u2019d accept partial vs. conditional funding. Briefly list options you've already exhausted and state whether partial funding, reimbursements, or in-kind help (e.g., an invitation letter for visa) would work. That reduces repetitive suggestions and invites more actionable responses.",
    "improvement_potential": "Very useful. The three points identify key, actionable omissions that materially reduce the chance of getting funding or useful replies: lack of a clear ask/timeline (donors need numbers and deadlines), no stated deliverables or ROI for funders, and no indication of what avenues have already been tried or what forms of support would be acceptable. These are not nitpicks \u2014 fixing them would make the post far more fundable and won\u2019t meaningfully bloat it, so the suggested fixes are high-impact and practical."

  "PostClarity": {
    "post_id": "Kzf7KsSrsfscTttTD",
    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The post is easy to understand, well-structured, and communicates the key ask (seeking funding) and motivation (career stage, project in Nigeria, visa urgency) clearly. It is concise and compelling in tone. It loses a little clarity because it omits practical specifics that would help responders (exact travel dates, estimated budget, what funding has already been tried or ruled out), so readers may need to ask follow-up questions before offering concrete leads."

    "novelty_ea": 2,
    "novelty_humanity": 3,
    "explanation": "Requests for funding to attend EA events after a scholarship rejection are very common on the EA Forum, so the core ask is not novel for that audience. For the general public it\u2019s also a familiar situation (seeking grants/donors to attend a conference). The slightly more original elements are the poster\u2019s specific project (phage-based technologies + AI for therapeutics in Nigeria) and the visa/time-sensitive angle, but those details do not make the overall post highly novel."

    "reasoning_quality": 6,
    "evidence_quality": 3,
    "overall_support": 4,
    "explanation": "Strengths: The post lays out a clear, coherent rationale for attending (career transition, specific project in Nigeria, networking and learning needs, visa urgency). The ask is concrete and the author communicates relevance to EA. Weaknesses: The post provides little empirical evidence or concrete details to substantiate the claims (no track record, impact metrics, budget, timeline, or prior funding attempts), and doesn't explain why EA Global is uniquely necessary versus other options. That limits credibility and makes it harder for readers to offer targeted funding suggestions."

  "PostExternalValidation": {
    "post_id": "Kzf7KsSrsfscTttTD",
    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 6,
    "validation_notes": "Most of the post\u2019s verifiable contextual claims are supported by public sources: EA Global runs a London conference and explicitly offers travel support; phage research and related work (including in Nigeria/West Africa) and use of AI in therapeutics are documented in the literature; antimicrobial resistance and vaccine access are established critical problems in low-resource settings; and Nigerian nationals generally need a UK visitor visa, which carries fees and processing requirements. However, the post\u2019s central personal claims (that this specific author applied for and was rejected for an EA Global scholarship, and that their team is building a particular platform in Nigeria) are private/individual and cannot be independently verified from public sources, so they remain unconfirmed. Overall: contextual claims = well supported; personal claims = unverifiable from public records, hence a mixed-but-leaning-positive score (6/10).",
