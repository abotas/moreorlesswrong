    "explanation": "Moderately important for the EA community: the post highlights a useful, under-emphasized angle (messaging about the moral 'Why' and movement-building) that could meaningfully affect outreach, recruitment, and thus scale of resources and ideas. It is not highly load-bearing or novel \u2014 EA already has outreach/movement-building efforts and long debates about messaging \u2014 and the post lacks empirical backing or detailed tactics. For general humanity the claim has some upside (wider adoption of prosocial norms could be very beneficial) but is speculative and indirect: whether moral framing succeeds and leads to large-scale policy or behavior change is uncertain, so impact is plausible but not guaranteed."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Over-simplifies the \u2018Why\u2019 and ignores mixed motives. The post treats moral altruism as the single right foundation for persuading people to join EA, but real-world motivation is often a mix of self-interest, identity, social norms, and moral concern. Revise to acknowledge plural motives and explain how you would combine moral-appeal messaging with pragmatic/self-interested frames (e.g., career benefits, community status, risk reduction). Actionable: add a short paragraph that (a) acknowledges multiple motivations, (b) proposes 2\u20133 audience segments (e.g., students, high-net-worth donors, policymakers) and (c) suggests testing different appeals with A/B experiments and measurable outcomes (donations, sign-ups, policy support).\\n\\n2) Incorrectly claims EA hasn\u2019t worked on outreach or persuasion; lack of engagement with existing work. The post asserts there\u2019s \u201cvery little material\u201d on convincing others, but several EA groups already run outreach, messaging, and recruitment research (e.g., 80,000 Hours, Giving What We Can, EA Outreach initiatives, Open Philanthropy research, and some moral-psychology work inside EA). Before publishing, do a brief literature scan and either (a) cite representative programs and explain the gap you see, or (b) narrow your claim to a specific under-researched question (for example: \u201ccomparative efficacy of moral-altruism vs self-interest framing across donor segments\u201d). Actionable: replace the blanket claim with 2\u20133 concrete references and a clearly defined, publishable research question.\\n\\n3) Missing discussion of political feasibility, trade-offs, and risks. The argument assumes scaling moral awakening is unambiguously positive, but large-scale recruitment can cause mission drift, politicization, or attract people whose priorities dilute EA\u2019s comparative advantage. Add a short section that (a) acknowledges potential downsides and trade-offs, (b) proposes safeguards (e.g., onboarding, governance, norms), and (c) lists concrete next steps\u2014commission a literature review, run small pilot campaigns with pre-defined success metrics, and publish the results. This will make the proposal more credible and actionable for readers who might fund or run such work.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback flags several substantive weaknesses that would materially improve the post. Point (2) calls out a factual overclaim \u2014 saying EA has done \"very little\" outreach is demonstrably false and embarrassing if left uncorrected \u2014 and sensibly urges quick literature/program citations or narrowing the claim. Point (1) correctly identifies an important conceptual oversimplification (treating moral altruism as the sole viable recruitment frame) and gives practical, low-burden fixes (acknowledge mixed motives, propose audience segments, suggest A/B tests). Point (3) raises real strategic risks (mission drift, politicization) and recommends brief, actionable mitigations and pilot studies. Together these are actionable, don\u2019t require major expansion of the post, and would make the argument much more credible. The feedback isn\u2019t perfect (could cite specific EA outreach studies or messaging research to make it even more useful), but overall it targets the main mistakes and offers practical next steps."

    "post_id": "zgDsnq4KAMncQeE5b",
    "clarity_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The post is well-structured and easy to follow (clear intro, headings, a simple What/How/Why framing, personal story and concrete 'Five truths'), so its main point \u2014 EA should emphasize the moral 'Why' to grow \u2014 comes across. Weaknesses: it is somewhat repetitive and rhetorical, offers few concrete examples or evidence to support claims, and could be tighter and more specific about target audiences and practical next steps. Improving concision and adding brief supporting evidence or actionable proposals would make the argument more compelling."

    "novelty_humanity": 4,
    "explanation": "Most of the post restates well-known EA themes (Singer/MacAskill origins, emphasis on doing the most good, tradeoffs between self-interest and altruism, movement-building). For EA readers this is mostly familiar critique \u2014 a low novelty score. The slightly more original element is the explicit framing that EA is neglecting the 'Why' as a distinct cause area and the concrete call for funding/research into moral awakening and persuasion as a priority; that specific proposal is somewhat less commonly treated but still has been discussed. For the general public the ethical framing is basic moral philosophy (not novel), though the combination of that framing with a strategic, research-focused proposal to scale altruistic motivation is modestly less common."

    "explanation": "Strengths: clear, coherent framing (What/How/Why), persuasive normative point about motivation, and useful personal testimony illustrating the claim. Weaknesses: major inferential leaps (e.g. that lack of moral 'why' is the primary growth bottleneck), little engagement with counterarguments or alternative explanations, no mechanism or theory-of-change for how moral awakening would scale policy influence, and almost no empirical evidence or citations. The post is a well-written opinion piece but is poorly supported by data or rigorous argumentation."

    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 7,
    "validation_notes": "Strengths: The post\u2019s descriptive claims are well-supported \u2014 Effective Altruism (EA) does emphasise cause areas such as global health & development, farm animal welfare, and AI safety; Peter Singer and William MacAskill are central intellectual figures; EA is still a relatively small but growing movement with donor concentration (e.g., Open Philanthropy) and active research communities. Major empirical warnings about climate change, biodiversity loss, food insecurity, displacement and health harms from insufficient global action are supported by authoritative sources (UNEP, IPBES, Lancet, World Bank). Weaknesses / caveats: The post\u2019s strongest causal claim \u2014 that EA\u2019s failure to promote the author\u2019s proposed \u201cWhy\u201d will itself directly cause outcomes such as \u2018\u2018surpassing 2.5\u00b0C\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018losing the fight to save critical species\u2019\u2019 \u2014 is speculative and not directly verifiable; warming and ecological outcomes depend on global emissions/policy trajectories and many actors, not any single movement. Similarly, statements framed as certainties (\u201cwe will\u2026\u201d) should be presented as conditional risks. Overall: factual background claims are accurate and supported; normative/causal claims about inevitability are plausible but overstated.",
