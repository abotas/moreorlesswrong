    "explanation": "I am not aware of a notable EA/rationalist figure named Ethan Spencer in major EA outlets (LessWrong, EA Forum, 80,000 Hours, CEA, OpenPhil) or of any prominent public/media presence under that name. It appears to be either a private/pseudonymous individual or a common name with no widely recognized prominence."
