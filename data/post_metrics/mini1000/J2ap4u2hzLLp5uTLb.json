It appears to be either a private/pseudonymous individual or a common name with no widely recognized prominence."

    "explanation": "This is a useful, somewhat load-bearing critique about EA messaging and implicit philosophical commitments: the post plausibly explains why the phrase \u201cdoing the most good\u201d encourages people to map EA onto consequentialist/utilitarian frameworks. That matters for recruitment, outreach, and internal clarity, and is worth discussing within the community, but it isn\u2019t foundational to EA\u2019s empirical claims or programmatic priorities. For general humanity the piece is niche \u2014 it might slightly affect public perceptions of EA but has limited direct impact on policy or large-scale outcomes."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Don\u2019t infer deep philosophical commitments from marketing language. The core move of the piece\u2014arguing EA is essentially utilitarian because it uses the phrase \u201cdo the most good\u201d\u2014is a weak inferential step. Sales/mission copy is often idiomatic; it doesn\u2019t by itself prove EA endorses utilitarian axioms. Either narrow your claim to: \u201cthis language contributes to the public perception that EA is utilitarian,\u201d or provide stronger evidence that EA\u2019s formal methods (value functions, objective metrics, tradeoff rules) systematically adopt consequentialist/utilitarian primitives. Actionable fix: add concrete examples of EA reasoning or documents that manifest consequentialist structure, or reframe the thesis to be about perception/language rather than ontological identity. \n\n2) Address obvious counterexamples and ethical nuance you currently ignore. You treat ethics as a binary (machine/consequentialist vs. non-machine) and don\u2019t engage with pluralism, moral uncertainty, rule-consequentialism, deontological arguments within EA, or EA actors who explicitly reject utilitarianism. This makes your argument look one-sided. Actionable fix: briefly acknowledge and either explain why these alternatives don\u2019t undercut your point or show how the language you criticise persists despite them (give one or two concrete EA examples where non-consequentialist reasoning is present and explain why language still skews consequentialist). \n\n3) Replace anecdote and pedantry with evidence and softer claims. The \u201cgood is not something you do\u201d line reads as semantic nitpicking and will alienate readers; it isn\u2019t a decisive philosophical objection and is contested in ordinary language and ethics literature. Actionable fixes: soften the claim to say the phrase is imprecise or rhetorically loaded, add citations/quotes (EA org mission statements, notable posts/interviews, Singer\u2019s work) to support your historical/origins claims, and if possible include a couple of short, concrete quotations or a tiny text-sample analysis to show how common the phrasing is. These changes will make the piece more persuasive and less likely to be dismissed as a linguistic pedant\u2019s complaint.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback targets the post\u2019s main weaknesses: over-inference from slogan-like language to deep philosophical commitment, omission of obvious counterexamples/nuance within EA, and a distracting pedantic tone. These are actionable, high-impact fixes (reframe claim, add concrete EA examples/citations, and soften wording) that would substantially strengthen the piece without requiring an undue expansion of length."

  "PostClarity": {
    "post_id": "J2ap4u2hzLLp5uTLb",
    "clarity_score": 7,
    "explanation": "Overall the piece is readable and has a clear thesis and structure: it explains why EA\u2019s wording (\u201cdo the most good\u201d) invites a consequentialist/utilitarian reading and supports that claim with concrete examples and repeated restatements. Strengths: logical progression, relatable examples, and an explicit aim. Weaknesses: it is sometimes repetitive and overly pedantic (school/arithmetic examples add length without advancing the core point), makes a few small rhetorical leaps (from phrasing to normative obligation) that could use tighter support, and contains minor typos/formatting issues\u2014so it could be more concise and slightly sharper in argumentation."

    "post_id": "J2ap4u2hzLLp5uTLb",
    "novelty_ea": 3,
    "novelty_humanity": 4,
    "explanation": "Most of the post\u2019s core claims are already familiar to EA readers: EA\u2019s historical ties to Singer, its consequentialist bent, and ongoing debates about language like \u201cdoing the most good\u201d have been widely discussed within the community. The specific linguistic quibble (\u201cgood\u201d isn\u2019t something you \u2018do\u2019) and the \u2018machine\u2011like\u2019 framing of ethics are mildly fresh turns of phrase, but they don\u2019t advance a substantially new argument. For a general educated audience the piece is slightly more novel because people outside EA are less likely to have seen the community\u2011internal debates framed this way, but the basic observation\u2014that emphasis on outcomes makes EA look utilitarian\u2014is still fairly intuitive and not highly original."

    "reasoning_quality": 6,
    "evidence_quality": 3,
    "overall_support": 5,
    "explanation": "Strengths: The post offers a clear, coherent causal account for why people conflate EA with utilitarianism\u2014tracing it to EA\u2019s consequentialist framing, the slogan \u201cdo the most good,\u201d and historical ties to Singer. The argument is structured, follows plausible logical steps (need for a metric \u2192 consequentialist framing \u2192 language that sounds utilitarian), and acknowledges some counterclaims. Weaknesses: The piece is primarily conceptual and rhetorical rather than empirical; it provides little concrete evidence (no surveys, citation of community statements, or historical documentation) to show that language actually causes the conflation. It sometimes glosses or overstates philosophical distinctions (e.g., treating consequentialism, utilitarianism, and the EA slogan as tightly coextensive) and downplays alternative explanations (pluralism within EA, deliberate distancing from utilitarian labels, or pragmatic slogan-choices). Overall, the thesis is plausible and partly well-argued, but under-supported by empirical or historical evidence and weakened by some philosophical overgeneralizations."

    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 8,
    "validation_notes": "Most of the post's factual claims are accurate and verifiable. Effective Altruism (EA) organisations and outreach pages do use language like \u201cdo the most good\u201d / \u201cdo the most good possible with our resources\u201d (see EffectiveAltruism.org's mission phrasing). ([effectivealtruism.org](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/?utm_source=openai)) The Life You Can Save (Peter Singer's organisation) explicitly uses the same language and lineage. ([thelifeyoucansave.org](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/?utm_source=openai)) EA's practical methods (focus on outcomes; cause-prioritization using importance/tractability/neglectedness) are standard parts of the movement's toolkit. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism?utm_source=openai), [effectivealtruism.org](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/resources?utm_source=openai)) The example that bednets (malaria ITNs) are much more cost\u2011effective for deaths averted than many typical local arts donations is supported by GiveWell's cost\u2011effectiveness estimates for AMF (GiveWell reports costs per net and estimates in the thousands of dollars per life saved, i.e., far more lives saved per dollar than typical domestic arts spending). ([givewell.org](https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/against-malaria-foundation-support-for-itn-campaigns-in-drc-june-2023?utm_source=openai), [givewell.site](https://www.givewell.site/charities/top-charities.html?utm_source=openai)) It is also true that Peter Singer and other consequentialist thinkers were influential in EA's origins and that many early/leading EA philosophers engage with consequentialist ideas, which helps explain the public association between EA and utilitarianism. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine%2C_Affluence%2C_and_Morality?utm_source=openai)) At the same time, prominent EA leaders (e.g., Will MacAskill) and movement statements explicitly deny that EA must be identical to utilitarianism and argue EA can be compatible with a range of moral views \u2014 so the author's note that many EAs themselves push back on the \u2018EA = utilitarianism\u2019 interpretation is also accurate. ([podcast.clearerthinking.org](https://podcast.clearerthinking.org/episode/206/will-macaskill-what-should-the-effective-altruism-movement-learn-from-the-sbf-ftx-scandal/?utm_source=openai), [forum.effectivealtruism.org](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/sfBgQFcsADryrdhwz/structural-flaws-in-the-ea-movement?utm_source=openai))\n\nWeaknesses / limits: several of the author's points are interpretive/philosophical (e.g., that EA's phrasing necessarily \u201cembeds a normative claim\u201d or is a \u201cmachine-like\u201d ethics); those are plausible readings but are normative/philosophical claims rather than straightforward empirical facts and so aren\u2019t directly provable/refutable by the kind of documentary evidence above. Overall: the post's empirical grounding is solid (hence a high score) though its stronger philosophical conclusions are interpretive rather than strictly empirical.",
