    "explanation": "This post raises a plausibly important but non\u2011foundational idea: that longtermist and EA priorities may overlook the preservation of meaning, culture, and emotional richness \u2014 a \u2018living risk\u2019 distinct from extinction or value lock\u2011in. For the EA community it is moderately important (6) because it could reshape cause\u2011prioritization, metrics, and interventions (e.g., cultural preservation, AI that models human flourishing) and sits adjacent to existing concerns like moral information and mental health \u2014 but it is currently speculative, fuzzy, and less tractable than core existential risks. For general humanity it is of moderate importance (5): if true it would affect large numbers of people\u2019s wellbeing and social fabric and suggest different policy and philanthropic priorities, but it is not an immediate survival\u2011level threat and faces measurement and intervention challenges that limit near\u2011term impact."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Make the concept operational and testable. Right now \u201cliving risk\u201d reads as a powerful intuition but is too vague to evaluate or prioritise. Define failure modes (e.g. persistent declines in meaning, ritual loss, cultural impoverishment, aesthetic anaesthesia), turn them into testable hypotheses, and list concrete, measurable proxies you would use (loneliness prevalence, participation in communal rituals, language extinction rates, validated meaning-in-life scales, arts engagement, indicators of cultural production). Suggest specific empirical approaches (longitudinal survey analysis, historical-comparative case studies, pilot interventions with pre-registered outcomes) so readers can judge tractability and scale.  Actionable change for the post: add a short paragraph that (a) defines 2\u20133 clear failure modes, (b) lists 4\u20136 plausible proxies you\u2019d track, and (c) proposes one small, concrete study or dataset to start with.\n\n2) Map the idea onto existing EA cause areas and explain what is truly new. The post risks reinventing or double-counting existing work (global mental health, value-lock-in, moral-information preservation, community development). Explicitly map overlaps and gaps: which aspects are already covered, where there are real blind spots, and what unique interventions only a \u201cliving risk\u201d framing would motivate. Actionable change for the post: include a short sentence or table-like line (one sentence each) linking living-risk subtopics to existing fields and saying why they are insufficient, or name 2\u20133 specific organizations/research areas you\u2019d partner with rather than starting from zero.\n\n3) Pre-empt key counterarguments on prioritisation, cultural bias, and measurement. Readers will rightly ask: what are the opportunity costs of shifting EA attention here, how do you avoid imposing a particular (e.g. Western) notion of \u201cliving well,\u201d and how do you know decline is causal rather than noise? Briefly acknowledge these trade-offs and propose safeguards: a) an explicit pluralist value framework and community-driven outcome-setting, b) cost-effectiveness-style pilots (small grants, RCTs or natural experiments) before scaling, and c) plans to test causality (instrumental variables, historical counterfactuals). Actionable change for the post: add one paragraph that lists the top 3 skeptical questions and a one-line answer and immediate next step (e.g., run a cross-cultural survey + one pilot intervention) to show you\u2019ve thought through the biggest objections.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback nails the post\u2019s biggest weaknesses: the central concept is vague, risks rehashing existing EA cause areas, and it doesn\u2019t pre-empt obvious prioritisation or cultural-bias objections. The three recommendations are concrete, actionable, and could be added briefly without bloating the post (define 2\u20133 failure modes + proxies; map overlaps/gaps with existing work; acknowledge and propose tests for key sceptical questions). Addressing these would move the piece from evocative to evaluable and markedly increase its credibility; it isn\u2019t fatal to the thesis, but without them the post is likely to be dismissed as poetic rather than policy-relevant."

    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The post is well-structured and easy to follow: it introduces a clear new concept (\"living risk\"), situates it in EA prioritization terms (neglectedness, scale, tractability, cost\u2011effectiveness), provides concrete examples, and ends with a clear call to action. Strengths include accessible language, logical flow, and effective use of EA frameworks. Weaknesses are some repetition (one section is duplicated), occasional poetic vagueness that reduces operational precision, and a need for tighter definitions or concrete indicators to make the argument more concise and actionable."

    "novelty_humanity": 3,
    "explanation": "Within EA the core intuitions overlap strongly with existing threads (value\u2011lockin, preserving moral information, longtermist concerns about quality of future lives, global mental health, and cultural preservation). What is moderately novel here is (a) the explicit naming/framing as a parallel \u2018living risk\u2019 to existential risk, (b) the proposal to treat cultural/experiential flourishing as a discrete EA cause area (with proxies like \u201caliveness per dollar\u201d), and (c) specific pragmatic suggestions (fund rituals, design AIs that model grief/longing, preserve languages/stories). For general humanity the ideas are much less new: worries about meaning-loss from tech, social media, automation, and cultural erosion are already widespread, so the piece\u2019s main novelty is mostly in its EA\u2011oriented framing and proposed research agenda."

    "overall_support": 5,
    "explanation": "Strengths: the post raises a coherent, novel conceptual concern (\"living risk\") that connects cleanly to EA frameworks (scale, neglectedness, tractability) and gives plausible examples and initial policy directions. It frames useful questions and potential proxies (loneliness, suicide, cultural loss) and is constructive about follow-up work. Weaknesses: the core concept is vague and conflates disparate phenomena (mental health, cultural change, aesthetic poverty), causal mechanisms are under-specified, and trade-offs with other priorities are not addressed. Empirical support is thin and largely anecdotal or journalistic; there are few rigorous citations quantifying magnitude, causal links, or tractability/cost-effectiveness. Overall, the idea is worth exploring further but is not yet strongly supported by evidence or tightly specified arguments."

    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 7,
    "validation_notes": "Most of the post\u2019s empirical claims are well-supported in the literature: (1) robust evidence links certain patterns of social-media / problematic digital use with increased depressive/anxiety symptoms and (in some modes of use) greater loneliness; (2) several high-quality syntheses and cross-temporal analyses show loneliness and poor social/meaning indicators have risen for many young adults over recent decades; (3) automation/self\u2011service and digitalisation are demonstrably reducing routine face\u2011to\u2011face interactions in retail, some services and parts of care; and (4) EA as a movement has substantial, documented activity and funding around AI safety, global health, farmed animal welfare, moral-circle discussion and \u201cpreserving moral information.\u201d However, some of the post\u2019s stronger empirical formulations are overstated or are conceptual claims that cannot be directly verified: e.g. \u201cmore people today are lonely than ever in human history\u201d is not empirically testable and is an overclaim; the idea that cultural \u201caliveness\u201d is already planetary in scale is plausible but currently evidentially heterogeneous across regions and requires more systematic measurement; and \u201cliving risk\u201d as a named category is a new conceptual framing rather than an established empirical quantity. Overall: major empirical premises have good support, but some global-scope statements are speculative or not precisely measurable yet.",
