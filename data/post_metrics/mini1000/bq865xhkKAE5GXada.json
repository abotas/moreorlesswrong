    "explanation": "This is a useful, clearly framed proposal for thinking about AI objectives and governance\u2014pairing time-discounting (\u03b4) with moral scope (w) is an intuitive way to capture two major failure modes (short-termism and narrow moral circles). For the EA/AI-safety community it is moderately important: it\u2019s a practical conceptual tool that can shape discussions about objective specification, RLHF design, and governance trade-offs, and it highlights many real technical and normative challenges (value-loading, Goodhart, capture). However it is not fundamentally novel or technically complete, and many of the hard problems remain (measuring v, preventing gaming, resolving normative disputes), so it isn\u2019t a load-bearing breakthrough. For general humanity the post\u2019s direct impact is smaller\u2014its ideas could influence high-level policy and alignment efforts (which matter a lot), but the specific framework is one of many competing proposals and would only matter at scale if adopted into concrete systems and institutions."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Serious mathematical/decision-theory error around \u03b4\u22651: you repeatedly suggest \u03b4\u22481 or \u03b4>1 as a way to \u2018\u2018prioritise the future\u2019\u2019. In an infinite-horizon additive utility \u03a3_t \u03b4^t v(t), any constant \u03b4\u22651 either makes the sum divergent or requires extra assumptions (e.g., v(t)\u21920 fast enough). That creates grave technical and decision\u2011theoretic pathologies (undefined optima, domination by arbitrarily distant futures, perverse incentives). Actionable fixes: (a) remove the casual suggestion that \u03b4>1 without qualification; (b) state concrete alternatives that avoid divergence \u2014 e.g. use \u03b4\u2208(0,1) with normative weighting in w or v, use finite planning horizons, average\u2011reward criteria from RL, or explicitly require convergence conditions for v(t); (c) if you want to favour future welfare normatively, add a short normative justification and a safe formal mechanism (bounded multiplier on future weights, diminishing returns, or maximin/regret formulations). Add one small worked example showing the divergence/pathology to make the point vivid.\\n\\n2) Underestimates how hard and normatively fraught the v\u2011vector and w aggregation problems are: turning plural, incommensurable moral values into measurable channels and scalar weights is the central, contested problem \u2014 not a minor technicality. Your governance sketch (experts + RLHF + constitutional guardrails) glosses over key failure modes: capture by elites, representativeness problems in RLHF, and irreconcilable moral disagreement. Actionable fixes: (a) Acknowledge upfront that value\u2011aggregation is the primary bottleneck and move some of your \u201climitations\u201d material earlier; (b) propose concrete, realistic governance primitives (e.g., multi\u2011theory ensembles for moral uncertainty, legally backed constitutional defaults, rotating/stratified stakeholder selection, dispute resolution procedures, and explicit fallback rules when consensus fails); (c) require that any proposal to change \u03b4 or w publish simulated downstream distributions of outcomes and sensitivity analyses before adoption. That keeps the post compact but materially increases credibility.\\n\\n3) Goodhart, gaming and RLHF representativeness are treated as manageable add\u2011ons but are core existential risks: metricising ethics creates incentives to manipulate signals, and your RLHF + Sybil\u2011resistance idea is under\u2011specified and optimistic. Actionable fixes: (a) Emphasise robust/uncertainty\u2011aware optimization (minimax, distributional robustness, bounded regret) rather than plain expected\u2011utility maximisation over a chosen v; (b) specify concrete anti\u2011gaming practices you will require (continuous adversarial red\u2011teaming, independent audits, anomaly detectors, clear human\u2011in\u2011the\u2011loop emergency controls, separation of powers between value\u2011setters and implementers); (c) acknowledge limitations of RLHF sampling and suggest how to construct representative, deliberatively informed datasets (deliberative polls, stratified panels, documented provenance) rather than relying on unspecified \u2018\u2018human feedback\u2019\u2019.",
    "improvement_potential": "Very useful. The feedback identifies a fundamental technical error (recommending \u03b4\u22651 without handling divergence/pathologies) that could embarrass the author and materially breaks the formalism unless fixed, and it also flags serious normative and implementation blind spots (value aggregation, Goodhart, RLHF gaming) with concrete, actionable remedies. Addressing these would substantially strengthen the paper without requiring an unwieldy rewrite."

    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "Strengths: The post is well-structured (TL;DR, clear sections, example, governance, limitations, and open questions), introduces \u03b4 and w early and uses a concrete utility formula and dam example to make the idea tangible. Weaknesses: A few technical terms and choices (e.g., value-channel specification, \u03b4>1 normative claim, orthogonality assumptions) are underexplained and presume domain knowledge; some tables/images reference could confuse readers if the visuals aren't visible. Overall it\u2019s clear and compelling for the target EA/technical audience but could be slightly tighter and more explicit for broader readers."

    "novelty_humanity": 4,
    "explanation": "Most of the post\u2019s core ideas are recombinations of well\u2011known concepts in ethics, economics, and AI alignment rather than wholly new claims. Explicit temporal discounting (\u03b4) and per\u2011agent/party weighting (w) are standard in utilitarianism, population/longtermist ethics, and RL/decision theory (discount factors, moral weights, value\u2011loading). The worries about Goodhart, governance, value\u2011loading, and the need for ensembles and constitutional guardrails are also familiar to the EA/longtermist audience. What is somewhat novel is the clean, operational framing\u2014presenting \u03b4 and w as adjustable \u2018knobs\u2019 to be governed (including the suggestion of \u03b4>1 as a constitutional choice) and the specific governance layering (expert assembly + continuous human RLHF + guardrails). That synthesis and emphasis on making those parameters explicit for AI alignment adds pragmatic value for non\u2011specialists, but it\u2019s largely an incremental, applied synthesis rather than a fundamentally original theoretical insight."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post presents a clear, coherent conceptual framework (\u03b4 and w) that maps known moral and temporal biases onto an implementable-sounding objective, and it thoughtfully enumerates limitations, governance issues, and mitigation strategies. The argument structure is logical and self-aware (e.g., acknowledging non-orthogonality, Goodhart, measurement problems). Weaknesses: The claims are largely conceptual and normative rather than empirically demonstrated. Key assumptions (e.g., that \u03b4 and w can be reliably measured/tuned, that \u03b4>1 is defensible as a constitutional choice, or that RLHF/assemblies can stably implement these knobs) are asserted without empirical or experimental evidence. The post lacks citations, case studies, simulations, or data showing the framework\u2019s tractability or robustness in practice. Overall: an interesting and plausible high-level proposal that would benefit from concrete operationalization, empirical validation, and demonstration of governance/robustness before being judged well-supported."

    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 7,
    "validation_notes": "The post is primarily a conceptual proposal, and its central empirical claims are modest and largely supported by existing literature: (1) humans display present-bias/discounting and short-termism (well-documented: hyperbolic/quasi\u2011hyperbolic discounting). (2) people show limited moral scope / in\u2011group bias and an attitude\u2011behavior gap (robust social\u2011psychology evidence, e.g., minimal\u2011group effects and moral hypocrisy). (3) RLHF and value\u2011loading are technically fragile: recent AI alignment literature documents fundamental limits (reward\u2011model misgeneralisation, specification\u2011gaming/Goodhart, and RLHF open problems). (4) Proposed technical mitigation approaches (value\u2011heads, Monte\u2011Carlo rollouts, importance sampling, Sobol sensitivity analysis) are standard, workable building blocks in ML/RL, but scaling them to reliably encode contested moral values is an open empirical and normative challenge. (5) Governance suggestions (Sybil\u2011resistant IDs, rotating expert panels, constitutional guardrails) match known desiderata but face well\u2011documented implementation and political risks (Sybil attacks and identity tradeoffs). Overall: most empirical assertions are supported by peer\u2011reviewed and community literature, but many claims are normative, speculative or engineering proposals whose real\u2011world performance remains uncertain \u2014 hence a \u201cwell\u2011supported\u201d (7/10) rating rather than higher.",
