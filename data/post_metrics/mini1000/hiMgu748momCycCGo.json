    "explanation": "This is a call-for-ideas from a credible charity-incubation group (Ambitious Impact) to identify interventions that combine climate mitigation/adaptation with global health or animal welfare. For the EA/rationalist community it is moderately important: it can shape the pipeline of new high-impact charities and research priorities, and could produce highly leverageable opportunities, but it is a preliminary, procedural step rather than a foundational research claim. For general humanity it is of minor importance in the short term \u2014 it may indirectly lead to valuable interventions if promising ideas are incubated and scaled, but the post itself has limited immediate impact or broad relevance."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Define concrete selection criteria and metrics (right now \u201ccost\u2011effective\u201d and \u201cco\u2011benefit\u201d are underspecified). Why this is important: contributors will submit wildly different kinds of ideas unless you say what you\u2019ll judge them on (e.g., timeframe, GHG accounting boundaries, cost per tCO2e avoided/added, DALYs averted, animal welfare metric). Actionable fixes: add 2\u20134 simple metrics/questions in the form (estimated costs, estimated GHG impact and timeframe, primary beneficiary, likely counterfactual, and evidence level). State any minimum thresholds or how you\u2019ll trade off climate vs health/animal outcomes.\n\n2) Narrow scope and give concrete templates/examples to raise signal. Why: the brief\u2019s very broad, which will produce a large long\u2011list full of low\u2011actionability ideas and increase your screening burden. Actionable fixes: list 3\u20136 priority subcauses you\u2019re especially interested in (e.g., low\u2011cost cookstove replacement with rigorous monitoring, agricultural feed additives for ruminants, mangrove restoration with clear livelihoods plan), and include a one\u2011paragraph example submission showing the short theory of change, rough cost/GHG numbers, and key uncertainties. Suggest a one\u2011page idea template in the form.\n\n3) Require contributors to address additionality, leakage, and key trade\u2011offs up front. Why: many climate+co\u2011benefit interventions have perverse effects (e.g., adaptation subsidies that lock in high\u2011emissions infrastructure, animal welfare interventions that increase consumption). Actionable fixes: add two form prompts: \u201cmain pathways by which this could fail or cause harm (leakage, rebound, perverse incentive),\u201d and \u201cwhy this is additional to current/planned funding.\u201d If you want fewer low\u2011quality submissions, make these short checkbox + one\u2011sentence fields rather than long essays.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback targets real, actionable weaknesses: underspecified selection criteria, an overly broad prompt that will produce low-actionability submissions, and failure to surface additionality/leakage risks. Implementing these fixes (especially simple form fields and an example/template) would substantially raise signal-to-noise and reduce screening burden without much extra length in the post. One caveat: the authors intentionally set a very low bar for submissions, so they should balance tighter prompts against reducing the diversity of long-list ideas."

Minor issues: a few phrases are slightly vague or repetitive (eg. \u201cor vice versa,\u201d what baseline for \u201ccost\u2011effective\u201d), the bulleted criteria could be tightened for readability, and a quick example of the kind of idea sought would reduce ambiguity."

    "explanation": "For EA Forum readers this is not very novel \u2014 EAs and groups like Charity Entrepreneurship, CEA, and climate/health researchers frequently discuss and solicit interventions that combine mitigation/adaptation with health or animal-welfare co\u2011benefits and run calls for charity ideas. The specific framing (AIM\u2019s entrepreneurship pipeline and explicit triage of animal welfare/global health with climate co\u2011benefits) is a small twist but still within well\u2011trodden territory. For the general public the idea is somewhat more unusual: many educated people know about climate co\u2011benefits in broad strokes (e.g. clean cookstoves, nature-based solutions), but systematically soliciting new charities optimized for combined climate+human/animal impact is less commonly considered."

    "overall_support": 4,
    "explanation": "This is primarily a solicitation rather than an argument, so the logical structure is straightforward and appropriate: AIM defines the scope, criteria, and asks for low-friction suggestions. That makes the reasoning adequate for its purpose. However, the post gives little justification for why this particular framing (seeking interventions with climate co-benefits) is expected to yield superior cost-effectiveness, and it lacks detail on how ideas will be evaluated or compared across sectors. Empirical evidence is essentially absent \u2014 there are no examples, prior results, metrics, or citations supporting the promise of this approach (beyond a brief organizational description). The call is reasonable as an early-stage input-gathering step, but its claims and goals would be much better supported by examples, a sketch of evaluation methods, and references to prior successes or literature on co-benefit cost-effectiveness."
