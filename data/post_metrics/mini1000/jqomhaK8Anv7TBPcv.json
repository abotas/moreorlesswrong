    "explanation": "A useful, practical resource for people in the EA/rationalist community seeking higher-impact careers. It can modestly improve career matching, job-hunting effectiveness, and the flow of talent into high-impact roles, so it has moderate importance for EA decision-making and outreach. It is not a foundational or novel theoretical claim, and its absence would not dramatically change major EA conclusions. For general humanity the effect is minimal \u2014 helpful to individuals who use it but negligible at society-wide scale."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) No evidence or credibility for effectiveness \u2014 The post announces a revised guide but gives readers no sense of who made it, why they\u2019re credible, or whether the guide actually helps. Actionable fixes: add the author(s)\u2019s relevant credentials or experience, summarize any evaluation/usage metrics (e.g. number of users, advising success rates, A/B tests, follow-up surveys), or include a short anonymized case study or testimonial showing concrete outcomes.\n\n2) Too promotional and link-heavy; missing a concise summary of what\u2019s new or important \u2014 Right now the post mostly links to the guide without describing why readers should click. Actionable fixes: include 2\u20134 concrete bullets summarizing the major changes in this revision, the most important practical recommendations from the guide, and one short example of actionable advice readers can use immediately. That will increase value for readers who skim and reduce the \u201cannounce-only\u201d promotional feel.\n\n3) Unclear target audience, costs, and conflicts of interest \u2014 The post claims the guide is for \u201cpeople at all stages\u201d and promotes advising signups, but doesn\u2019t state who will benefit most, whether advising is paid, or how you handle conflicts/privacy. Actionable fixes: specify the ideal reader profile (e.g. early-career EA, mid-career pivot, etc.), clearly state whether 1:1 advising is free or paid and typical time/price commitments, and add a short transparency note about any selection criteria, funding sources, or potential conflicts of interest.",
    "improvement_potential": "This feedback hits the post\u2019s three biggest weaknesses: lack of credibility/evidence, skim-unfriendly announce-only format, and unclear audience/pricing/conflict transparency. Each point is actionable and can be implemented with a small amount of added text (author credentials, 2\u20134 bullets summarizing changes/value, and a short note on advising costs/selection). These changes would meaningfully improve trust and click-through quality without bloating the post; they aren\u2019t catastrophic errors but are important omissions the author should fix."

    "clarity_score": 9,
    "explanation": "Clear, well-structured and concise announcement: purpose is stated up front, key contents and audience are described, and next steps (signup, advising, contact) are easy to find. Minor weaknesses: it could briefly note what\u2019s new in the revision and who the primary intended audience is (e.g. level of experience or EA alignment) and avoid many inline links breaking flow, but these are small issues."

    "post_id": "jqomhaK8Anv7TBPcv",
    "novelty_ea": 2,
    "novelty_humanity": 3,
    "explanation": "For an EA audience this is not very novel \u2014 it largely repackages well-known EA career-advice topics (matching motivations, career hypotheses, application strategies) already covered by 80,000 Hours, EA Forum posts, and other orgs. The main newness is an updated/organized guide, email-serialized summaries, and 1:1 advising. For the general public the focus on explicitly \"impactful\"/EA-style careers is a bit less common than generic career advice, but the underlying ideas and services (career guides, job-application help, coaching) are familiar, so overall still low novelty."

    "evidence_quality": 2,
    "overall_support": 2,
    "explanation": "Strengths: The post clearly summarizes the guide\u2019s scope and intended audience and lays out concrete topics covered, which makes the claim plausible. Weaknesses: It offers no evidence that the guide actually improves outcomes (no user data, testimonials, success metrics, studies, or examples), and it makes an implicit effectiveness claim without justification. The argumentative content is minimal and mostly promotional rather than evidence\u2011based. To be more convincing the post would need empirical results, user feedback, or more detail about how the recommendations were developed and validated."

    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 8,
    "validation_notes": "Most factual claims in the post are verifiable and accurate: the Probably Good career guide exists online, the guide is organized into 8 chapters and includes the specific topics the post lists (matching motivations, mapping options/career hypotheses, how to land jobs, diagnosing/overcoming obstacles, etc.), and the site offers an email/newsletter signup and a free 1:1 advising application and contact form. These items are directly shown on Probably Good\u2019s website. The only weaker claim is the wording \u201csignificantly revised version\u201d \u2014 that is partly subjective and I found evidence of past updates (EA Forum posts announcing new chapters in 2022 and the org\u2019s 2020 introduction) but no explicit public changelog phrasing I could find that labels the current guide as a single, newly \u201csignificantly revised\u201d release. Overall: well-supported but with one subjective claim that couldn\u2019t be fully corroborated as a discrete \u201csignificant revision\u201d event from public pages.",
