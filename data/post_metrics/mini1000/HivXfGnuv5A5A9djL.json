    "explanation": "This is a practically useful announcement for the EA/effective-giving ecosystem: it directs OpenPhil funding toward fundraising organizations, clarifies eligibility/selection criteria, and could meaningfully affect which effective-giving groups scale (they estimate ~$1\u20132.5M available and claim high adjusted returns on donations). It\u2019s not foundational theory or a paradigm-shifting claim, but it is operationally important for teams seeking funding and for the shape of the effective-giving landscape \u2014 moderate importance for EA actors. For general humanity the post is of minor importance: any benefits are indirect (potentially more money flowing to high-impact charities), the dollar scale is modest relative to global needs, and the content is an administrative funding call rather than a broad policy or scientific breakthrough."

    "robustness_score": 3,
    "actionable_feedback": "1) Opaque and potentially misleading impact metric (\"adjusted return on donations\") \u2014 this is the clearest and biggest weakness. You state portfolio-level ~6x (up to ~8x) but only give a brief, high-level description of the adjustments (\"perceived cost-effectiveness\" and \"counterfactuality\"). That makes it hard for applicants to: (a) understand how you'll judge their track record; (b) reproduce or contest your estimate; and (c) know what data to include in applications. Actionable fixes: publish a short methodological appendix or worked example showing the formula, the sources/priors you use for effectiveness and counterfactuality, and how you convert adjusted money raised into an ROI per dollar of expenditure. Allow applicants to submit their own counterfactual estimates and say how you will combine applicant-supplied and funder-estimated numbers.\n\n2) Vague definition of eligible \"effective giving organizations\" and weak guardrails against perverse incentives. The eligibility list is very broad (platforms, advisors, match programs, awareness groups, etc.) but there is no minimum standard for what counts as 'raising funds for effective charities' or how you will treat organizations that raise for a mix of high- and low-priority causes. This risks funding groups that mainly increase overall charitable giving to less-effective causes, or gaming attribution (e.g., claiming donors would have given nothing otherwise). Actionable fixes: add explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria or minimum standards (e.g., percent of funds directed to specified lists of high-priority charities/focus areas, or demonstrated ability to steer marginal donations to high-impact opportunities). Explain how you will treat mixed portfolios and how you estimate marginal vs. fungible donations.\n\n3) Ambiguity about grant sizing, renewal policy, and dependency risks for applicants. Several statements conflict or are unclear (\"we aim to represent at most 50% of operational funding for more established organizations\" vs \"comfortable contributing a larger percentage for newer organizations\"; grants are \"non-renewable by default\" but existing renewables will be assessed on schedule). This makes it hard for applicants to plan budgets and assess whether applying is worth the effort. Actionable fixes: clarify typical grant sizes or ranges, the expected number of awards if possible, explicit policy on renewals vs one-time top-ups, and whether you will consider multi-year renewable funding for high-performing applicants. If exact numbers are unknown, provide clear decision rules (e.g., how you decide cap percentages by maturity) so applicants can make an informed choice about applying.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback identifies three clear, high-impact weaknesses: an opaque impact metric that applicants can\u2019t reproduce or respond to; overly broad eligibility that risks perverse incentives or gaming; and unclear grant-sizing/renewal rules that harm applicants\u2019 budgeting decisions. Addressing these would substantially improve the RFP\u2019s transparency and usefulness without requiring a complete rewrite (appendices or decision rules would suffice). It isn\u2019t a fatal critique of the RFP, so not a 10, but it flags critical issues the authors should fix."

Strengths: logical organization, specific timeline and funding range, and examples of current grantees. Weaknesses: a few terms and metrics (e.g., \u201cadjusted return on donations\u201d, \u201c(U)HNW\u201d) assume familiarity and could be explained more immediately; some selection criteria are high-level/vague (how track record and counterfactuality will be quantified), and a few paragraphs could be tightened for conciseness."

    "explanation": "For EA Forum readers this is largely an administrative announcement from a major funder rather than a new idea \u2014 Open Phil has long run effective-giving grants, RFPs, and similar selection criteria; the only mildly novel bits are the quantified 'adjusted return on donations' (~6\u20138x) and some grant-structure preferences (top-ups, % of operational funding). For the general public, the focused framing around 'effective giving', the use of adjusted ROI-like metrics for donations, and the specific incentives for donor-funneling groups are somewhat unfamiliar but not groundbreaking \u2014 it\u2019s more a specific funding program than an original conceptual contribution."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post lays out a clear, coherent rationale for an RFP (identify more effective giving orgs, standardize applications), provides concrete programmatic details (eligibility, funding structure, selection criteria), and gives examples of existing grantees. It also attempts to quantify impact with an \"adjusted return on donations\" metric. Weaknesses: Key claims (e.g., ~6x adjusted return) rely on internally derived, underspecified calculations with no uncertainty bounds or independent validation. Important methodological details are missing (how effectiveness and counterfactuality were estimated, sample size, time horizon, potential donor substitution), creating risk of selection and confirmation biases. The post doesn't present broader empirical evidence that additional funded organizations would reliably achieve similar returns or that the metric predicts marginal impact. Overall: reasonably argued and operationally thorough, but empirical support is limited and insufficiently transparent to strongly justify the central impact claim."

    "validation_notes": "The major empirical claims in the post are accurately reported from primary Open Philanthropy materials. The RFP text, the program update (Mar 14, 2025), and individual grant pages confirm: the RFP existed and was posted by Open Philanthropy; named grantees (Giving What We Can, Effektiv Spenden, Doneer Effectief) appear in Open Philanthropy\u2019s grants database; the program states effective giving \u224870\u201371% of the program portfolio; the portfolio ROI \u22486x and some grantees show adjusted returns up to ~8x per Open Philanthropy\u2019s internal analysis; the RFP budget range (~$1M\u2013$2.5M), application timeline (April 2025 deadline / closed Apr 21 update), and contact (Melanie Basnak) are all present on the official RFP page. Caveats: the \u201cadjusted return on donations\u201d figures are explicitly Open Philanthropy\u2019s internal estimates and methodology (they are reported transparently on their pages) but are not independently audited here \u2014 so while the post accurately reports Open Philanthropy\u2019s claims, those specific impact/ROI numbers rely on internal assumptions and are not externally validated in the public domain.",
