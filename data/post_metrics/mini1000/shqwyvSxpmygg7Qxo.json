    "explanation": "This is a useful, practical announcement for the EA community: a modest-sized grant round focused on meta and movement-building projects that can have high leverage for EA priorities. It isn\u2019t a foundational or theory-changing post, but it meaningfully affects funding opportunities and could enable valuable work. For general humanity the direct effects are minimal given the small scale, though there is some downstream potential if funded projects scale."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Be explicit about funding size & what to ask for. The post doesn\u2019t say typical grant amounts or how many projects you expect to fund this round (only last round totals). Applicants need a sense of scale to decide whether it\u2019s worth applying and how to scope budgets. Action: add a typical grant-size range (or at least median/min/max from prior rounds) and an example budget template or link to a funded-project budget from a retrospective.\n\n2) Clarify the selection criteria and decision-making process. It\u2019s unclear how applications are scored, who makes the final decisions (donors individually? a committee? consensus?), whether donors see application materials, and how conflicts of interest are handled. That ambiguity creates wasted effort and potential reputational risk. Action: include a short rubric or list of evaluation criteria, describe who reviews and votes on decisions, explain whether donors/reviewers get access to applications, and link or state your COI policy.\n\n3) State eligibility & post-award expectations up front. The post doesn\u2019t specify whether individuals can apply, whether for-profits are eligible, geographic restrictions beyond \u201cLMIC movement-building\u201d interest, or reporting/monitoring requirements if funded. Action: add a concise eligibility checklist (entity types, geographies, prior funding constraints) and outline reporting/deliverables and expected timelines for payments and follow-up so applicants can prepare appropriate proposals.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback points out important, practical omissions that would materially help applicants (typical grant sizes, who decides and how, COI handling, eligibility and reporting expectations). Without those clarifications applicants may waste time or submit poorly scoped proposals. Some of this information might already be in the linked \u201cwhat you need to know\u201d document or retrospectives, so the feedback could have checked that first, but overall these are critical and actionable improvements that shouldn\u2019t substantially lengthen the post if added concisely."

    "explanation": "Well-structured announcement: clear title, calls to action, deadlines, process steps, and timeline. Application requirements (100-word summary, 2-page main document, review stages) are explicit and easy to follow. Minor weaknesses: a few unexplained acronyms/jargon (LMICs, CE, 'Meta' category expectations) and no explicit info on typical grant size or strict eligibility rules, which could help applicants further. Overall concise and easy to act on."

    "explanation": "This is primarily an administrative announcement for a recurring grant round \u2014 a common genre on the EA Forum. The format, timeline, and ask (apply/donate) are standard; the only mildly specific content are the preferred focus areas (UHNW advising, effective-giving orgs, LMIC movement-building), which are familiar topics within EA. To general readers it\u2019s also just another funding call and not a novel conceptual contribution."

    "explanation": "This is primarily an informational/call-for-applications post rather than an argument, and its reasoning is clear and well-structured: it states priorities, the application process, timeline, and what applicants should submit. Strengths include clear expectations (word/page limits), transparency about timelines, and links to past retrospectives and outcomes (69 applications, 10 funded, $362,893 granted), which help applicants judge fit. Weaknesses: the post provides limited detail on selection criteria, typical grant sizes, how impact is evaluated, and evidence of the longer-term effectiveness of funded projects beyond retrospectives (the retrospectives are linked but not summarized). For its purpose (announcing a funding round), the support is good; for claims about impact or demonstrable effectiveness of funding choices, the empirical support is modest and would need more metrics and evaluation detail."

The referenced guidance post (\u201cWhat you need to know\u2026\u201d) and the JotForm application/join forms exist and match the links in the post. Historical numbers (last round: 69 applications, 10 funded, $362,893 granted) are reported in the published third-round retrospective.
