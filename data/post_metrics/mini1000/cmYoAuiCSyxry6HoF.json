    "explanation": "This is a moderately-to-highly important post for the EA/rationalist community because it highlights systemic frictions that can prevent promising, non-traditional projects from getting traction (visibility biases, funding catch-22, volunteer vs paid help, and mental-health/financial costs). If accurate and widespread, these frictions would justify changes in funding mechanisms, talent scouting, and support for part-time builders (e.g. bridge grants), which could materially affect what projects get built. For general humanity it is of minor importance: the piece is primarily community-facing and anecdotal. Its broader impact is indirect and speculative \u2014 only if the community responds and funds many high-return out-of\u2011pathway projects would there be large downstream effects."

    "explanation": "I could not identify a well-known EA/rationalist figure under the name/handle 'Brad West\ud83d\udd38'. There are multiple people named Brad West in different professions, but none appear prominent in EA/rationalist spaces; overall public profile appears minimal or limited to niche/online accounts."

  "PostClarity": {
    "post_id": "cmYoAuiCSyxry6HoF",
    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "Overall clear and readable: the post is well-structured with clear headings, a strong narrative arc (problem, personal evidence, costs, lessons, calls to action), and concrete examples (projects, infrastructure, a paid collaborator). Comprehensibility is high \u2014 the author\u2019s experience and main points come through without heavy jargon. Argument clarity is good: the central claim (that valuable EA work happens outside recognized pathways and is under-supported) is consistently stated and supported by personal anecdotes and practical recommendations. Main weaknesses are repetitiveness and length (some points\u2014visibility, funding catch-22, emotional costs\u2014are reiterated), occasional sweeping claims (e.g., the $100B figure and the competitive-advantage mechanism) that would benefit from tighter evidence or phrasing, and a somewhat vague funding/next-steps ask. Tightening the claim-evidence links and pruning repeated lines would make it more concise and even more compelling."

    "novelty_ea": 4,
    "novelty_humanity": 2,
    "explanation": "Most of the post\u2019s claims are familiar: part\u2011time founders face visibility gaps, funding catch\u201122es, burnout, and trouble getting credible volunteers \u2014 these themes appear often in EA meta discussions and startup/social\u2011enterprise literature. The call for EA bridge funding for non\u2011traditional builders and the personal, concrete account of trying to build \u201cProfit for Good\u201d while lawyering add some fresh, EA\u2011specific color. The central mechanism (consumers/employees preferring firms that give to charity, producing a competitive advantage and philanthropic multiplier) is decisive for the project but is a variant of well\u2011known cause\u2011marketing/social\u2011enterprise ideas, not a radically novel economic insight. Overall it\u2019s mildly novel for EA readers but not new to broader audiences."

    "reasoning_quality": 5,
    "evidence_quality": 3,
    "overall_support": 4,
    "explanation": "Strengths: The post is clear, candid, and logically organized. It presents a plausible mechanism (stakeholder preference for charity-linked firms \u2192 competitive advantage) and a coherent account of the time, health, and financial trade\u2011offs faced by part\u2011time builders. The author acknowledges uncertainty and frames many claims as personal impressions, which improves epistemic humility. Recommendations (e.g., bridge funding, valuing non\u2011traditional contributors, paying for dependable help) follow sensibly from the described problems.\n\nWeaknesses: The central empirical claims\u2014especially the claim that Profit for Good could redirect ~$100B annually or that profit\u2011donating companies systematically outcompete others\u2014are not supported with rigorous quantitative evidence here. The post mainly offers anecdotes, outputs (articles, talks, a conference, a website) and personal cost accounting rather than controlled studies, market data, consumer willingness\u2011to\u2011pay estimates, competitive analyses, or pilot outcomes demonstrating the model scales. Broader generalizations about community behavior and funding bias are plausible but rely on single\u2011actor experience and selection effects; alternative explanations (execution issues, idea viability, signaling, or market constraints) are not ruled out. \n\nBottom line: The writeup is a valuable and credible personal data point about barriers faced by non\u2011traditional, part\u2011time project builders and makes reasonable policy suggestions, but its substantive claims about PFG\u2019s large\u2011scale effectiveness lack the empirical backing needed to be highly persuasive."

  "PostExternalValidation": {

    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 6,
    "validation_notes": "Most concrete, checkable claims in the post are valid: the Profit for Good Initiative / Profit4Good website, the TEDx talk and blog posts, the Commissions for a Cause pilot, and the Profit for Good conference (School for Moral Ambition, Peter Singer keynote, Rutger Bregman closing) are all publicly visible. The author\u2019s claim that consumers / other economic actors have a non\u2011zero preference for charities (the mechanism the author calls \u201cCharity Choice\u201d) is supported by academic literature showing positive effects of CSR / cause\u2011related attributes on consumer behaviour and (on average) on firm financial outcomes \u2014 though effects are heterogeneous and context dependent. However, two major empirical claims are overstated or speculative: (a) the claim that \u201cvirtually no one \u2014 except Daniel Flynn \u2014 discussed this mechanism\u201d is contradicted by many prior examples and organizations (Newman\u2019s Own, Humanitix, Who Gives a Crap, Thankyou, etc.) and by a public literature on profit\u2011donating / purpose companies; (b) the claim that PFG \u201ccould redirect $100 billion annually\u201d is plausibly numerically possible in scale (global/US corporate profits are in the trillions), but the post provides no empirical modelling or evidence that the PFG model could reliably capture or redirect that magnitude \u2014 this is a speculative projection rather than a demonstrated empirical fact. Personal reports of burnout, health and finances are plausible but anecdotal and not externally verifiable. Overall: infrastructure and outputs = well supported; core behavioral mechanism = supported by literature though magnitude is uncertain; claims of novelty and specific large-scale impact ($100B) = insufficiently evidenced.",

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Major unsupported claims and missing counterarguments \u2014 your core claim (that Profit for Good can redirect ~$100bn/year and that PFG companies will systematically outcompete traditional firms) is presented as a near-fact but lacks the models, data, or falsifiable assumptions needed for readers to evaluate it. This is likely to undermine credibility with funders and EA reviewers. Actionable fixes: add a one\u2011page summary of the key quantitative assumptions (market size, consumer preference size, elasticity, adoption timeline), link to any empirical pilots or A/B tests you have, or \u2014 if you don't have those yet \u2014 list concrete, testable experiments you plan (e.g., a retail pilot showing X% willingness-to-pay or conversion lift, a supplier/employee survey with N respondents) and what outcomes would change your priors. Also explicitly address the most plausible counterarguments (shareholder law/governance constraints, free-riding, regulation, consumer indifference, adverse selection) and say how PFG overcomes them or what would falsify the idea.\n\n2) Vague asks and no clear funder-friendly milestones \u2014 you repeatedly request \u201cbridge funding\u201d but give no budget, timeframe, or milestones that a potential funder could evaluate. That makes it hard for readers to act on your post. Actionable fixes: include a concise funding ask (e.g., $X for Y months) with a one-line budget breakdown and 3\u20134 concrete milestones (e.g., hire a program manager, run 30 pilots, validate 1 business model with \u2265Z uplift, publish a third-party evaluation). If you want smaller commitments, offer tiered asks (e.g., $25k for a pilot, $100k to validate, $200k to transition to full-time) and state success metrics for each tier.\n\n3) Tone and framing risk alienating the community \u2014 the post mixes valuable personal testimony with a somewhat adversarial framing of EA decision\u2011makers (\u201cthey assume existing paths are sufficient\u201d), which may make readers defensive rather than helpful. Actionable fixes: separate the personal narrative from the pitch (keep a short empathy paragraph, then switch to an evidence-first section), soften language that attributes bad faith, and explicitly acknowledge why funders are cautious (risk, evalability, opportunity cost). Offer concrete ways EA orgs could mitigate those concerns (e.g., conditional grants, milestones-based payments, small rapid pilots, third\u2011party evaluation, fellowships for part\u2011time builders) so readers with influence can see practical next steps rather than just a grievance.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback identifies the post's biggest weaknesses: making a huge quantitative claim without transparent assumptions or testable evidence, asking for funding with no budget/milestones, and using a framing that will likely put potential supporters on the defensive. Each point is actionable and addresses mistakes the author would likely be embarrassed to have overlooked. Fixing these would substantially increase credibility and the likelihood of support, without requiring excessive expansion of the post."
