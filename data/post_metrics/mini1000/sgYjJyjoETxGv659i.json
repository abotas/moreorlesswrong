    "explanation": "This is a pragmatically useful, moderately important intervention-level recommendation. For the EA/rationalist community it matters because it directly informs cause prioritization and funding strategy for global health and development \u2014 pushing donors and agencies toward fewer, simple, cost\u2011effective, large\u2011scale programs can improve cost-effectiveness and spending leverage. However it is not foundational to core EA worldviews (e.g., longtermism or AI safety), and it involves familiar tradeoffs (loss of innovation, context specificity, political constraints), so it\u2019s not decisive for all decisions. For general humanity the idea could produce meaningful improvements in how aid is delivered and thus benefit many people if widely adopted, but the scale is limited by political realities and the total size of aid budgets, so its impact is important but not transformative."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Overly strong claim that \u201cProjects should do one thing on a large scale\u201d based on fixed costs \u2014 missing nuance about when scaling actually reduces per\u2011person cost. Actionable fix: qualify the claim and add criteria/evidence for when scale delivers lower unit costs (e.g., interventions with low variable costs, high standardisability, and robust cross\u2011context RCT evidence). Give 1\u20132 concrete examples where scaling works well and 1\u20132 where it doesn\u2019t, or cite literature on scaling/diminishing returns.\n\n2) Big organization/design risk from concentrating on fewer, larger projects and \u201cfewer staff.\u201d Actionable fix: acknowledge and address the concentration risk explicitly. Propose guardrails such as staged scale\u2011ups (pilot \u2192 phased expansion), maintaining a dedicated M&E/oversight team, and keeping a small portfolio/diversification across geographies or intervention types to hedge against large failures.\n\n3) Neglect of heterogeneity and equity tradeoffs (hard\u2011to\u2011reach populations, local adaptation, political/implementation constraints). Actionable fix: add a short paragraph on distributional and contextual tradeoffs and concrete selection criteria: require evidence of replicability across contexts, explicit plans for reaching marginalised groups (even if costlier), and rules for when to prioritise equity/coverage over pure unit cost. These changes keep the post short while removing its biggest overgeneralizations.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback targets the post's main weaknesses: an overgeneralised claim about scale economies, the risks of concentrating funding/staff on fewer large projects, and omission of heterogeneity/equity tradeoffs. Each point is concrete and offers short, actionable fixes that would materially improve the post without bloating it. These are critical clarifications the author should make to avoid misleading readers, though they don't render the core intuition entirely wrong, so a score below maximal is appropriate."

    "explanation": "Overall clear and concise: the post states a simple, focused thesis (favor large-scale, single-purpose interventions) and gives credible sources and short supporting quotes. Strengths: easy to understand, well\u2011structured, and appropriately brief. Weaknesses: lacks concrete examples or evidence to back the claims, and phrases like \u201cone thing\u201d and \u201creform the review process\u201d are a bit vague about who should act and how."

    "explanation": "The core claims \u2014 prioritize simple, proven interventions, achieve economies of scale because of high fixed/setup costs, and streamline review/processes to fund fewer large programs \u2014 are well-worn in EA and aid-effectiveness circles (GiveWell, CGD, Glennerster's own work, JPAL, etc.). For the general educated public these ideas are somewhat less ubiquitous but still not highly novel: the broad notion of \u2018do fewer things and scale what works\u2019 and calls to simplify bureaucracy are common in policy debates, though some operational details (fixed-cost-driven per-person cost reductions, specific review reforms) may be less familiar."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The core claim invokes a well\u2011known economic principle (economies of scale and high fixed costs for design/oversight), and the authors are credible practitioners which lends plausibility. The recommendation to prioritize simple, cost\u2011effective, large\u2011scale interventions is clear and practically actionable. Weaknesses: The argument is presented as an assertion with little nuance \u2014 it ignores heterogeneity across contexts, potential increases in marginal costs or quality losses at scale, political and governance constraints, and trade\u2011offs between simplicity and targeting. Empirical support is minimal in the excerpt: no data, studies, or concrete examples are cited to show that cost per person \u2018\u2018falls sharply\u2019\u2019 across the kinds of aid projects under consideration or that concentrating budgets on a few interventions yields better outcomes. Overall: Plausible and partially convincing on theoretical grounds but under\u2011evidenced and oversimplified in practice; stronger, context\u2011specific empirical evidence (cost\u2011per\u2011beneficiary curves, case studies of scaled programs, meta\u2011analyses) would be needed to make the claim robust."

    "validation_notes": "The core empirical claim \u2014 that per\u2011person implementation costs often fall as programs scale because fixed design/setup/oversight costs are spread over more beneficiaries \u2014 is well supported in the development and global\u2011health literature. Systematic reviews and program data (e.g., mass deworming, HIV/syphilis testing) report clear economies of scale for many interventions, and programs like Deworm the World document very low per\u2011child costs at large scale. However, the evidence is context\u2011dependent: scaling can incur higher short\u2011term costs, produce diseconomies (logistics, quality control, equity losses), and cost\u2011effectiveness estimates are often uncertain when generalized. The post\u2019s recommendation to concentrate on \u201csimple, cost\u2011effective, large\u2011scale interventions\u201d is therefore plausible and evidence\u2011informed, but empirical support is mixed across intervention types and settings and requires case\u2011by\u2011case economic evaluation and attention to pitfalls (quality, equity, contextual fit). The authors\u2019 factual claims about their affiliations and (Glennerster\u2019s) membership of Giving What We Can are verifiable; Haria\u2019s GWWC membership is asserted in the EA Forum linkpost but I could not find a public GWWC listing separately confirming Haria as a pledger.",
