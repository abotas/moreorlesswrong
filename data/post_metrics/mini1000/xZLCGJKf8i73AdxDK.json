    "explanation": "This paper addresses a concrete, high-leverage methodological problem for AI safety and capabilities evaluation: latent or sandbagged capabilities can make evaluations misleading, and some elicitation techniques (notably fine-tuning and anti-refusal training) are much more effective than others. For the EA/AI-safety community this is highly relevant because it directly affects red-teaming, benchmarking, release decisions, and regulatory testing \u2014 it\u2019s not foundational theory but it is load-bearing for practical evaluation pipelines (hence a high score). For general humanity the impact is more indirect: better elicitation affects how well society can detect dangerous capabilities and craft policy, but the work is technical and incremental rather than transformative. Caveats: experiments use engineered \u201cmodel organisms\u201d and limited tasks (MCQA, APPS), so results may not transfer perfectly to all deployed large models; nevertheless the findings and the novel circuit-breaking methodology are practically useful and worth attention."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Ecological validity / overgeneralization: the \"model organism\" setup (password-locked and circuit-broken models) is a useful lab tool but is plausibly quite different from how real-world sandbagging or latent capabilities manifest. The post currently leans toward broad recommendations (e.g. \"fine-tuning should be the method of choice\") without making clear the boundary between results on these artificial organisms and real deployed models. Actionable fixes: add a short paragraph explicitly stating the limitations of the model-organism abstraction, justify why your constructs plausibly map onto realistic sandbagging behaviors, and (if possible) run at least one small auxiliary experiment on a public, unmodified model or a different sandbagging mechanism to demonstrate transfer. If such experiments aren\u2019t possible, temper claims and change wording from general recommendations to recommendations conditional on the model-organism assumption. \n\n2) Possible confound with fine-tuning and leakage: the strong result for fine-tuning is important but could be driven by obvious confounds (e.g., fine-tuning on data that overlaps the eval, iatrogenic capability changes, or trivial memorization of the password-behavior). Actionable fixes: (a) explicitly report fine-tuning data and ensure no overlap with evaluation examples; (b) report pre/post fine-tune performance on held-out tasks that are not in the fine-tune distribution to show you are uncovering latent capability rather than creating it; (c) add control fine-tuning conditions (e.g., fine-tune on unrelated tasks, or fine-tune with/without password examples) and report significance/CI for gains. These controls will make the recommendation to prefer fine-tuning much more credible.\n\n3) Incomplete evaluation of activation-steering methods: concluding that steering \"isn\u2019t effective\" risks being driven by a narrow implementation/hyperparameter choice rather than a general property of steering. Actionable fixes: add an explicit ablation table for steering methods (different procedures, strength parameters, layers, optimization settings), or at minimum document the full steering recipe and justify why it\u2019s representative. If resource limits prevent comprehensive ablation, tone down the claim (e.g. \"the steering variants we tested were ineffective under our circuit-breaking protocol\") and highlight that further work should explore other steering families and diagnostics (e.g., circuit-level readouts) before generalizing.",
    "improvement_potential": "Targets three central, high\u2011impact weaknesses: overgeneralizing from synthetic \"model organisms,\" a plausible fine\u2011tuning leakage/confound that could trivially explain the main win for fine\u2011tuning, and drawing broad conclusions about steering from a narrow implementation. Fixing these would substantially improve credibility without requiring wholesale rewriting (add limits, report controls/held\u2011out checks, or temper claims), so the feedback is highly useful."

    "explanation": "Overall clear and well-structured: it has a concise TL;DR, a readable abstract, a logical method/results/takeaways flow, and practical recommendations. Weaknesses: a few small typos/formatting issues (e.g. \"developersmay\"), some domain-specific terms (\"circuit-breaking\", \"activation steering\") are not defined for non-expert readers, and figures are referenced without captions or quantitative detail, so readers who want precise numbers or method definitions must consult the paper."

    "novelty_ea": 6,

    "explanation": "For an EA/rationalist audience this paper is moderately novel. Many readers will already be familiar with the problem of \u201csandbagging\u201d, password-locked models (e.g. Greenblatt et al.), and basic elicitation techniques (prompting, few-shot, fine-tuning, activation steering). The most original contributions here are (a) the circuit-breaking training method for creating more robust model\u2011organisms with hidden capabilities, and (b) the systematic, empirical head\u2011to\u2011head evaluation across multiple tasks (MCQA and code) showing when different elicitation techniques work or fail (notably activation steering\u2019s limited effectiveness and the superiority of fine\u2011tuning/anti\u2011refusal for some tasks). Those points raise new practical and methodological implications, but the high\u2011level idea (hidden capabilities can be revealed and must be tested for) is already well discussed in the community. For the general public this work is substantially more novel: most people have not encountered the technical methods for creating/evading hidden capabilities or a systematic comparison of elicitation techniques, so the paper\u2019s experiments and the circuit\u2011breaking idea will feel quite new."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post presents a clear, logically organized argument and a sensible experimental approach (creating \"model organisms\" with password-locked and circuit-broken hidden capabilities) to test different elicitation techniques. Evaluating multiple techniques (prompting, activation steering, fine-tuning), using two distinct task types (MCQA on a WMD-related set and programming/APPS), and releasing code/results are all positive for reproducibility and grounded inference. Weaknesses: The summary overgeneralizes from a limited experimental scope \u2014 the post doesn\u2019t report important details (model families and scales, training/seed variance, quantitative metrics, statistical significance, exact steering methods tried), so ecological validity and generality are uncertain. The artificially constructed model organisms (and the specific circuit-breaking method) may not closely mirror real-world sandbagging or deployed systems, and some elicitation techniques (and variants) may not have been fully explored. Overall, the reasoning is coherent and the empirical work is promising, but the evidence as presented in the post is moderately limited, so conclusions should be taken as provisional pending fuller methodological details and broader replication."

    "validation_notes": "The EA Forum post is an accurate high-level summary of the authors' empirical findings: the arXiv paper reports that supervised fine-tuning (including anti-refusal training) is the most reliable elicitation method, prompting (few-shot + prefilling) can often elicit MCQA capabilities, and activation/activation-steering is generally much less effective \u2014 especially on the authors' circuit-broken model organisms. The paper, the ICML poster entry, and the authors' code release corroborate the experimental claims and provide reproducibility materials. Key caveats: the work is a preprint / poster (not a journal paper), experiments use relatively small models (Mistral 7B, Gemma 2 9B) and particular benchmarks (WMDP, MMLU, APPS), so generalization to larger models / other tasks is uncertain; and the statement \u201cactivation steering isn\u2019t effective\u201d is a slight overgeneralization \u2014 steering sometimes helps on some model/benchmark combinations (e.g., Gemma on MCQA) but fails notably on APPS and on circuit-broken variants. Overall: well-supported by primary sources, but with the usual limits of a preprint and narrow experimental scope.
