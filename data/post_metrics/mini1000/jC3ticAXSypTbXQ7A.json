    "explanation": "Useful, well-sourced literature summary about the composition, economic contribution, crime rates, and effects of legalizing or deporting undocumented migrants in the U.S. It is a helpful evidence synthesis for people working on migration policy, fiscal analyses, or domestic policy advocacy, and it meaningfully informs public debate. However, it is not foundational to core EA priorities (e.g., AI risk or longtermist cause selection) and thus is of moderate importance to the EA community. For general humanity the post is more consequential: its conclusions bear on policies that affect millions of people and public perceptions about immigration, so errors would have material real\u2011world effects on policy and welfare."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Understated measurement & sample-selection problems \u2014 The post notes uncertainty in counts but then treats CPS/Pew-derived statistics (employment, wages, taxes) as if measurement error is minor. Key issues: misclassification from fake SSNs/ITINs, undercoverage of the CPS/ACS for undocumented people, and systematic differences in who responds to surveys. Actionable fix: add a short, explicit subsection that (a) lists the main measurement biases for each outcome (wages, employment, taxes, crime), (b) cites alternative estimation methods (residual method, survey-based adjustments, administrative-linkage studies) and their divergent estimates, and (c) reports ranges or sensitivity checks rather than single-point statements (e.g., \u201c11\u201316M\u201d + how that range alters key conclusions). This prevents the reader from over-interpreting precise numbers.  \n\n2) Overreliance on a few papers and a crude fiscal adjustment \u2014 The fiscal section leans on Borjas + Nowrasteh-style NPV accounting and a flat 10% downward adjustment for wage penalties. That approach is fragile: it ignores dynamic/general-equilibrium effects (children\u2019s lifetime tax contributions, local vs national fiscal burdens, remittances), heterogeneity by age/sector, and methodological critiques of the cited papers. Actionable fix: present competing high-quality estimates (e.g., CBO-style, academic meta-analyses, Clemens\u2019 critique) side-by-side, briefly explain key methodological differences, and avoid a single-point NPV claim \u2014 instead report a plausible interval and the assumptions that would flip sign (e.g., inclusion of K\u201312 spending for citizen children, differing discount rates).  \n\n3) Causal claims need stronger caveats (deportations, crime, legalization) \u2014 Several causal statements (e.g., deportations reducing native wages, undocumented commit less crime) are supported by literature but sensitive to identification choices (policing intensity, selection into sanctuary cities, enforcement endogeneity). Actionable fix: for each causal claim, add one sentence about identification threats (e.g., policing variation, reverse causality, external validity) and, where relevant, cite at least one study with a contrasting finding or limitation. This keeps readers from overgeneralizing the policy implications and signals the strength of each inference.",
    "improvement_potential": "This feedback targets major, non-trivial weaknesses: understated measurement and sample-selection issues, an overreliance on a narrow fiscal accounting approach (with a crude 10% adjustment), and under-acknowledged identification threats in causal claims. Fixing these would materially improve credibility and prevent readers from over-interpreting precise numbers, and can be done with a modest, focused addition (a short methods caveat/subsection and a few sensitivity ranges or competing estimates) rather than a complete rewrite."

    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The post is well organized (clear headings, logical flow from demographics to employment, wages, fiscal effects, crime, legalization) and heavily sourced, which makes it easy to follow the author\u2019s descriptive aim. Language is generally accessible and the key points are communicated directly. Weaknesses: the piece is long and data-dense (many numbers and papers) so readers may lose the narrative thread; frequent footnotes and parenthetical asides interrupt flow; a concise executive summary or clearer signposting of main takeaways would improve conciseness and argumentative focus. Overall, readable and solidly clear but somewhat verbose for a forum post."

    "explanation": "This is mainly a concise synthesis of existing academic and policy literature rather than new claims. Most findings (demographics, high labor-force participation, low crime rates, net fiscal contribution debates, effects of legalization, and the Secure Communities/deportation studies) summarize well-known papers and public sources (Pew, Borjas, Clemens, Nowrasteh, etc.). A few specific empirical points (e.g., the flattening wage profile for undocumented workers, the calibrated/causal estimates on deportations reducing native wages) are less prominent in mainstream coverage, but they are drawn from published work and not novel hypotheses. Overall the post is informative and well-sourced but not original research or theory."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post is well-structured, careful about scope, candid about measurement limitations, and supports claims with numerous citations across demographic, labor, fiscal, deportation, and crime literatures. It avoids strong causal claims where evidence is weak and generally ties conclusions to the cited studies. Weaknesses: Some claims rely heavily on a few contested or methodologically sensitive papers (e.g., Borjas, some Cato/heritage analyses), there is limited engagement with contrary/more recent meta-analyses or alternative methodological approaches, and the fiscal conclusions are sensitive to assumptions that are acknowledged but not fully explored. Overall, the main thesis (undocumented people work at high rates, are not more criminal, and are likely net beneficial or at least not a large fiscal drain) is reasonably well supported but not definitive given measurement uncertainty, heterogeneity within the population, and the contested nature of some cited work."

    "validation_notes": "Most of the post\u2019s major empirical claims are supported by standard, reliable sources (Pew Research Center, Borjas\u2019s NBER work, Edwards & Ortega, ITEP, and recent quasi\u2011experimental papers on enforcement). Key validated points: the Pew 2022 estimate (~11 million unauthorized in 2022; \u22483.3% of the U.S. population and ~23% of foreign\u2011born), that the unauthorized population peaked around 2007 and fell then rose again by 2022, high labor\u2011force participation (\u22488.3M workers in 2022 \u2192 \u224875% of an 11M unauthorized population), Borjas\u2019 findings on high employment propensities for undocumented men and flat age\u2011earnings profiles, Edwards & Ortega\u2019s ~3% GDP contribution estimate, ITEP\u2019s tax payment totals (~$96.7B in 2022, ~$59B federal / ~$37B state & local), and evidence that undocumented immigrants are not more crime\u2011prone (PNAS 2020; other work). However, I found some incorrect or imprecise figures in the post: (1) the IRCA 1986 legalization total is misstated \u2014 about 2.7 million people ultimately obtained legal status under IRCA (not 1.7M); (2) the Texas 2006 comptroller figures are misquoted (the Strayhorn 2006 report reports ~$1.58B generated in state revenues and ~$1.44B in uncompensated local costs, not $424M generated); and (3) a few origin\u2011country percentage claims (e.g., exact shares for India/Canada/Europe) are imprecise and depend on the year/data source (MPI and Pew give somewhat different shares and the composition changed sharply 2021\u201323). Overall: the review is well\u2011sourced and accurately summarizes most of the literature, but contains a few notable numerical errors and some imprecise phrasing about origins and historical amnesty counts, so I rate it a 7.",
