    "explanation": "This post provides useful, actionable evidence about a neglected operational problem in farmed-animal advocacy: many undercover investigators are underpaid, volunteer or freelance, and suffer substantial mental/physical harms. For the EA/advocacy community this is moderately important\u2014if true it should influence budgeting, hiring, training, retention, and mental-health/support priorities for a major cause area, and it points to strategic weaknesses that could reduce campaign effectiveness. However the study is small (n\u224847), self\u2011selected and self\u2011reported, so conclusions are suggestive rather than definitive and not foundational to EA\u2019s core models (hence not higher than a 6). For general humanity it is of limited scope: ethically relevant to animal welfare and NGO practice but not of systemic global importance (\u22483)."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Major sampling & transparency weakness \u2014 the post treats a 47-respondent survey as broadly representative without showing key methodological details. Actionable fix: add (or link to) clear methods: how investigators were recruited, response rate (47 of ~130?), inclusion/exclusion criteria, geographic/work-status breakdown, full questionnaire, and whether answers were anonymous. Explicitly acknowledge self-selection and small\u2011n limits and avoid generalizing beyond the sampled group. If possible, share de\u2011identified data or an appendix with cross-tabs so readers can judge robustness.\n\n2) Misleading statistical comparisons and missing denominators \u2014 income and health statistics are presented in a way that invites misleading comparisons (e.g., comparing a median $80k across \u201call job levels\u201d in the U.S. to investigators from 22 countries without controlling for full/part\u2011time status or cost of living). Actionable fix: report denominators for every percentage (e.g., \u201c65% of 47 respondents\u201d), separate results by employment status (freelance/volunteer/part\u2011time/full\u2011time) and region where possible, and avoid cross\u2011population comparisons unless you adjust or clearly caveat them. Consider simple uncertainty statements (e.g., wide CIs, \u2018\u2018small sample\u2019\u2019) and remove or qualify sweeping numeric contrasts.\n\n3) Overstated causal/general claims and sensational wording \u2014 statements like \u201cthe likelihood of being arrested and spending time in jail is high\u201d and claims that the movement\u2019s treatment \u201cundermines its own capacity for impact\u201d exceed what the presented data supports. Actionable fix: tone down causal language or back it with citations/qualitative examples; separate anecdote from survey evidence; where you argue strategic consequences, add supporting evidence (case studies, follow\u2011up interviews, or literature) or explicitly label these as plausible implications rather than proven effects. Doing so will make the piece more credible and less likely to be dismissed as advocacy spin.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback correctly identifies major weaknesses that would materially harm the credibility of the piece: lack of sampling/method detail, misleading cross-population comparisons, and several overstatements going beyond what the small, self\u2011selected survey can support. The recommended fixes are concrete and actionable (add methods, report denominators, caveat claims or add evidence) and would substantially improve the post without requiring an entirely new study. It stops short of claiming the thesis is invalid, so a score below 10 is appropriate, but failing to implement these points would leave the post significantly weakened and open to justified criticism."

    "explanation": "The post is overall clear and well-structured: it opens with a gripping hook, states a central problem, and supports it with survey data and concrete statistics. Strengths include accessible language, a logical flow from problem to evidence to implications, and a clear call to treat investigators better. Weaknesses are repetition and some melodramatic phrasing, occasional imprecise presentation of statistics (e.g., different denominators like 47 vs 29 respondents), a few strong claims without nuance (e.g., \"likelihood of being arrested... is high\"), and a tendency toward lengthiness \u2014 it could be more concise and more explicit about methodology and limitations."

    "explanation": "For EA Forum readers this is only moderately novel: the broad claims (investigators face safety and emotional costs, are undervalued, and the \u2018hero\u2019 narrative masks systemic problems) are familiar to people who follow animal advocacy and movement critiques. The most new element for that audience is the concrete survey data (international sample, percentages unpaid/underpaid, health impacts) which provides useful quantification but doesn\u2019t overturn prior consensus. For the general public the post is more novel: many non\u2011specialists will be surprised by the prevalence of unpaid/freelance investigators, the extent of low pay, and the documented emotional/health toll \u2014 though the general idea that undercover work is risky and stressful is not unprecedented in mainstream coverage."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post is logically organized, frames a clear problem (investigators are vital but marginalized), and uses primary survey data to back up key claims (compensation, freelance status, health impacts, and qualitative responses about financial insecurity). It also links the findings to a broader strategic argument about retention and movement effectiveness. Weaknesses: The evidence base is limited and under-documented \u2014 47 self-selected respondents from a ~130-person community is small and likely non\u2011representative; survey methodology, question wording, and response rates per item are not reported; measures are self\u2011reported and subject to bias; important contextual details (full\u2011 vs part\u2011time, hours worked, cost of living, regional differences) are missing; and some comparisons are apples-to-oranges (global investigator incomes vs. a U.S. median across all job levels). The reasoning sometimes stretches beyond what the data can confidently support (moving from suggestive, descriptive results to broad claims of systemic failure) but remains plausible. Overall, the post provides useful, novel descriptive evidence that raises legitimate concerns, but the empirical support is suggestive rather than conclusive and would benefit from a larger, more transparent, and more rigorous study."

    "validation_notes": "Most of the post\u2019s empirical assertions are directly supported by the Faunalytics survey it links to: the survey had 47 respondents from 22 countries; respondents most often said their investigations support legislative campaigns (36), vegan outreach (31) and corporate campaigns (20); about half of respondents identified as freelance (25) and ~28% as volunteers (13); ~65% (30/46) reported earning 0\u201319,999 EUR/USD from investigations; 63% reported occasional-to-regular financial concerns; 18 open responses mentioned financial security/compensation (18/29). These items are visible in the Faunalytics \u201cThe Most Boring Survey 2024\u201d PDF. The post\u2019s comparison to Faunalytics\u2019 separate 2024 compensation report (median \u2248 $80,000 for U.S. farmed-animal-advocacy roles) is also correct. However, the post contains a clear factual error: it states \u201c65% of investigators reported that this job has affected their health,\u201d whereas the survey pie chart shows 65% answered \u201cNo\u201d and 35% \u201cYes\u201d to \u201cDo you think this job has influenced your health?\u201d (the post inverted this result). Major methodological limitations (small sample n=47, self-selection, membership-limited sampling / non-representative international mix, self-report measures) mean findings are suggestive but not definitive for the wider population of animal-industry investigators. Overall: most empirical claims match the survey PDF, but the incorrect health-statement and the small/nonrepresentative sample reduce confidence.",
