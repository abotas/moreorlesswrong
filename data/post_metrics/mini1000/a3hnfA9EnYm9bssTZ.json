    "explanation": "For the EA / rationalist community this is a high\u2011importance post: it challenges a central methodological premise (that impartial expected\u2011value comparisons reliably guide cause prioritization) by isolating \u2018unawareness\u2019 as a distinct, structurally serious problem. If the core claims hold up, they would force important rethinking of longtermist decision\u2011making, prioritization heuristics, and the justification for major programs (AI safety, lock\u2011in strategies, etc.). The argument is not entirely novel (connects to \u201acluelessness\u2018 literature) but frames a usable critique that could materially affect EA strategy and norms \u2014 hence a high score. For general humanity the immediate impact is limited: the piece is technical and internal to ethical/prioritization debates, so even if true it mainly shifts academic and movement\u2011level reasoning rather than everyday decisions or near\u2011term policy in an obvious way."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Overstates the practical defeat of action-guidance without engaging decision\u2011theoretic responses. The post argues that unawareness makes EV comparisons indeterminate, and leaps to the conclusion that impartial altruism \u201closes action\u2011guiding force\u201d. But there are well\u2011developed approaches to decision\u2011making under imprecision/unawareness (imprecise probabilities / Walley; maximin / maximin\u2011expected\u2011utility; minimax\u2011regret; info\u2011gap/robustness analysis; robust\u2011satisficing). Either (a) show why those frameworks fail to rescue action guidance in the particular sense you care about, or (b) narrow the claim to the limited sense in which impartial EV is undermined while other decision rules remain live. Actionable change: add a concise section that (i) lists the main formal alternatives and related literature (Walley, Levi, info\u2011gap, minimax\u2011regret, imprecise probability literature, Mogensen/Greaves/Steele & Stef\u00e1nsson), and (ii) explains\u2014briefly and with one example\u2014why they do or do not address the kind of unawareness you describe.\n\n2) Conflates two distinct claims: (A) impartial altruism fails to provide a determinate, epistemically grounded ranking of strategies, and (B) therefore you have no reason at all to support EA causes over ordinary local concerns. Those are different. The first is an epistemic/technical claim about precise EV\u2011comparisons under unawareness; the second is a stronger normative claim about overall reasons and practical decision\u2011procedures for bounded agents. Actionable change: separate these claims up front and be explicit about which one you are defending in each section. If you intend to defend the stronger normative conclusion, add argumentation bridging the gap (e.g., why permissive \u201cfallback\u201d heuristics don\u2019t constitute genuine impartial reasons). If you only intend the epistemic claim, soften the rhetoric so readers don\u2019t take away blanket nihilism.\n\n3) Paper is high on abstraction and low on diagnostic criteria / positive examples, which makes it easy to dismiss as general skepticism. Right now the vignette is suggestive but doesn\u2019t show cases where unawareness flips the sign of interventions in a way that couldn\u2019t be handled by robustness checks. Actionable change: include one or two concrete mini\u2011case studies (worked numerical or qualitative scenarios) where you (a) model a coarse hypothesis and a plausible family of refinements, (b) show how reasonable choices about those refinements give opposite signs for EV, and (c) explain why common robustness tools wouldn\u2019t resolve the ambiguity. Alternatively, add a short checklist or criteria for when unawareness is \u201csevere enough\u201d to warrant suspension of judgment (so readers can tell whether the argument applies to a given cause). This keeps the piece persuasive without lengthening it much.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback targets substantive gaps that would materially weaken the post if left unaddressed: (1) it presses the author to engage existing formal decision frameworks that plausibly rescue action-guidance under imprecision (a crucial omission), (2) it rightly demands a clearer separation between an epistemic claim about indeterminacy and the stronger normative claim that EA gives no practical reasons to act, and (3) it asks for concrete diagnostics or worked examples to show the phenomenon isn\u2019t just abstract skepticism. Addressing these would significantly strengthen the argument without requiring excessive lengthening (e.g., a short section listing formal alternatives and one worked mini-case or checklist)."

    "explanation": "Well structured and audience-appropriate: the post states a clear central claim, lays out a roadmap, uses headings/key takeaways and a concrete vignette, and cites relevant literature \u2014 which makes it easy to follow for an EA/academic audience. Weaknesses: it is dense and fairly long, uses technical jargon and assumes background knowledge (so non-specialists will struggle), and repeats some points; a tighter executive summary and crisper early definitions of key terms (e.g. \u2018\u2018unawareness\u2019\u2019 vs \u2018\u2018uncertainty\u2019\u2019) would improve accessibility and concision."

    "explanation": "For EA readers the post is moderately novel. It develops and stitches together existing strands (Greaves & MacAskill on cluelessness, Mogensen on maximal cluelessness, Roussos, decision\u2011theory literature) but contributes a distinctive framing: separating unawareness into coarse\u2011graining vs. restricted awareness, treating that as a formal source of irreducible indeterminacy (interval EVs rather than ordinary uncertainty), and arguing that common EA \u201crobustness\u201d fixes don\u2019t resolve this. Those moves are persuasive and focused, but build on well\u2011known debates rather than overturning them. For the general educated public the package is substantially more novel: the technical complaint (that unknown\u2011unknowns can make impartial EV comparisons genuinely under\u2011determined and thereby undermine action\u2011guidance) and its implications for longtermist EA strategy will be new to most non\u2011specialists."

    "evidence_quality": 5,
    "overall_support": 6,
    "explanation": "Strengths: The post is conceptually clear and well-structured, distinguishes unawareness from ordinary uncertainty, lays out mechanisms (coarse vs restricted awareness), anticipates objections, and situates the argument in relevant literature (Greaves, Mogensen, Steele & Stef\u00e1nsson, etc.). The chain of reasoning is internally coherent and the AI vignette concretely illustrates how unawareness can flip intuitive EV judgements. Weaknesses: The claims rest mainly on philosophical argumentation and illustrative scenarios rather than empirical or formal demonstration that the indeterminacy is ubiquitous or irreducible in practice. Key premises \u2014 e.g. that catch-all hypotheses cannot be usefully constrained, or that pragmatic heuristics and meta\u2011epistemic priors cannot resolve the imprecision \u2014 are plausible but not decisively established. The post engages some counterarguments but stops short of fully ruling out systematic responses (robust priors, formal models of ignorance, or decision rules that tolerate imprecision). Overall: a thoughtful, well-argued challenge that raises important issues and merits serious consideration, but not yet a definitive refutation of action-guidance from impartial altruism without further formalization and empirical/analytic support."

    "validation_notes": "Concise assessment: The post is largely a philosophical/epistemic argument rather than an empirical report, and its central empirical claim \u2014 that \u201cunawareness\u201d (distinct from ordinary uncertainty) is a serious, under-appreciated problem for longtermist/EAs decision\u2011guidance \u2014 is well grounded in existing academic literature. Work in decision theory and epistemology has explicitly studied limited awareness / unknown possibilities and their consequences for expected\u2011utility reasoning (e.g., Steele & Stef\u00e1nsson 2021). ([cambridge.org](https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/beyond-uncertainty/8ED794C02E2BEAB14E4A42B7295F8228?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Major prior EA\u2011relevant discussions of \u201ccluelessness\u201d and deep uncertainty (Greaves 2016; Mogensen 2019/2020) likewise document related worries about drawing action guidance from naive EV calculations.

([read.dukeupress.edu](https://read.dukeupress.edu/the-philosophical-review/article-abstract/133/1/1/386836/The-Nature-of-Awareness-Growth?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [joeroussos.org](https://joeroussos.org/research/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) The post\u2019s empirical/empirically\u2011informed claims that EA literature recommends \u201crobust\u201d strategies (broad interventions, heuristics, focus on lock\u2011in, research and saving, etc.) are also supported by public EA and affiliated writings (e.g., Tomasik 2015, Karnofsky/GiveWell 2014, Greaves & MacAskill 2021). ([longtermrisk.org](https://longtermrisk.org/charity-cost-effectiveness-in-an-uncertain-world/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [blog.givewell.org](https://blog.givewell.org/2014/06/10/sequence-thinking-vs-cluster-thinking/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [globalprioritiesinstitute.org](https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/hilary-greaves-william-macaskill-the-case-for-strong-longtermism/page/25/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\nWhere the post slightly overstates the empirical novelty: the author claims (roughly) that \u201cto my knowledge, no existing case for cluelessness has acknowledged unawareness as a distinct epistemic challenge, except Roussos (2021).\u201d That is too strong \u2014 the literature on limited awareness / unknown possibilities (Steele & Stef\u00e1nsson 2021; Paul & Quiggin 2018; Bradley 2017; de Canson 2024, etc.) was already addressing awareness growth and related issues before or around Roussos\u2019 2021 talk, and Greaves/Mogensen\u2019s work on cluelessness engages the same family of problems. ([cambridge.org](https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/beyond-uncertainty/8ED794C02E2BEAB14E4A42B7295F8228?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [read.dukeupress.edu](https://read.dukeupress.edu/the-philosophical-review/article-abstract/133/1/1/386836/The-Nature-of-Awareness-Growth?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [philpapers.org](https://philpapers.org/rec/GREC-38?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [globalprioritiesinstitute.org](https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/andreas-mogensen-maximal-cluelessness/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) So this particular historical/literature claim is partly inaccurate.\n\nOverall judgement (why an 8/10): most major descriptive claims about the existence, formal study, and relevance of unawareness for longtermist reasoning are correct and documented in peer\u2011reviewed and working\u2011paper literature; the post\u2019s argument that unawareness can produce severe indeterminacy in EV comparisons is a plausible philosophical conclusion that builds on that literature. The remaining weaknesses are (i) one modest overstatement about the novelty/uniqueness of Roussos\u2019 contribution, and (ii) the fact that the strongest conclusion \u2014 that impartial altruism must often suspend judgment or cease to give action guidance \u2014 is a normative/philosophical inference rather than an empirical claim that can be decisively verified by data. That inference is defensible but contestable; it depends on contested choices of decision\u2011theoretic principles and how one models the \u201ccatch\u2011all\u201d unknowns, so it cannot be treated as an empirically established fact.
