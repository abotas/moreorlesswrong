    "explanation": "Useful, well-articulated cultural critique of EA: argues that \u2018doing good\u2019 is too abstract to sustain passion and retention, and proposes concrete ways to make EA more mission-like (goals, narratives, rituals, org-level targets). If right, this matters for recruitment, retention, morale, accountability, and optics \u2014 real but non\u2011foundational changes to how EA operates. If wrong, little harm done beyond some wasted time on cultural experiments. For general humanity the stakes are smaller: mostly indirect effects via EA\u2019s effectiveness and staffing, so limited global impact."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Avoid overgeneralizing from anecdotes \u2014 add empirical grounding and tighten scope. You repeatedly move from personal vibes and a handful of conversations to claims about why people leave or drift from EA. Either (a) frame the piece explicitly as a personal-phenomenology essay (keep anecdotes and tone), or (b) if you want to make broad claims, add supporting evidence: cite EA survey results, retention data, exit-questionnaire themes, prior qualitative studies, or at least a short informal poll. Even one concrete data point (e.g., % citing \u201clack of purpose\u201d on an EA survey) would make the post far more credible and prevent readers from dismissing it as mere impressionism.\n\n2) Directly confront the main counterarguments and tradeoffs of \u201cmission-izing.\u201d The core proposal (make EA more mission-like / concrete goals, rituals, heroes) has well-known downsides you barely engage with: metric fixation and gaming, reduced pluralism, increased risk of capture/corruption or cultish dynamics, suppression of epistemic hygiene, and loss of EA\u2019s comparative advantage as a meta/analytical community. Add a short section that (a) enumerates these risks, (b) explains why you think they are manageable for the particular interventions you propose, and (c) proposes concrete mitigations (e.g., rotating leadership, sunset clauses, rigorous M&E tied to missions, checks and balances to avoid tribalism). This will stop the post from feeling one-sided and make your recommendations more persuasive.\n\n3) Make your concrete proposals operational or pare them back. The flowcharts, timelines, centralized info, and rituals are useful ideas but currently read as high-level wish-list items. For each proposed intervention pick one to flesh out as a minimal, implementable pilot: specify who would own it, how it would be updated, governance and curation rules, cost/maintenance estimates, and success metrics (e.g., uptake by X% of newcomers, measured change in self-reported mission clarity). If you prefer to keep the post short, remove the long list and include one well-developed pilot (or a short appendix) so readers can judge feasibility rather than dismissing the ideas as naive.\n\nAddressing these three weaknesses will keep your candid tone and memorable anecdotes while substantially increasing the post\u2019s credibility, reducing obvious pushback, and making your suggestions more actionable for the community.",
    "improvement_potential": "Targets three major weaknesses: sweeping anecdotal claims, failure to engage obvious counterarguments around mission-izing (cultishness, metric fixation, loss of epistemic hygiene), and vague wish-list recommendations. Fixing these would substantially raise credibility and actionability and can be done without bloating the post (reframe as personal essay or cite a few data points, add a short risk/mitigation section, and flesh one pilot)."

    "explanation": "Overall clear and readable: the piece has a strong structure (headings, sections, and a TL;DR), a stated thesis and concrete examples/suggestions (flowcharts, timelines, media). That makes the central claim \u2014 that \u201cdoing good\u201d is too vague to function as a motivating mission and EA would benefit from more mission-like concreteness and shared emotion \u2014 easy to identify. Weaknesses: the post is long, occasionally repetitive and meandering, leans heavily on anecdotes/vibes (which sometimes leaves claims imprecise), and contains many parenthetical asides and footnotes that break flow. With tighter editing to remove repetition and sharpen some arguments, it would rate higher."

    "explanation": "Most of the post\u2019s core claims are familiar to EA readers: critiques that EA is overly abstract/rational, needs better narratives, that AI safety functions like a \u2018mission\u2019, and calls for more storytelling/rituals and concrete goals have all been argued on the Forum before. The somewhat more original bits are the practical, community-facing suggestions (cause-area flowcharts, skill-gap visualizations, treating meta vs object-level work as distinct \u2018missions\u2019, and using emotional\u2011tuning language to diagnose drift), and the explicit framing of AI safety as a less\u2011EA\u2011like but more missional exemplar. Those elements add some useful concreteness, but they aren\u2019t highly novel either for a general audience familiar with social\u2011movement theory or for experienced EAs."

    "overall_support": 4,
    "explanation": "The post is thoughtful, well-structured and internally coherent: it lays out a clear claim, sketches plausible psychological and organizational mechanisms (concreteness, achievability, shared emotion), contrasts EA with mission-driven movements and uses AI safety as a illustrative counterexample. It also acknowledges trade-offs and uncertainty. However the argument relies heavily on anecdote, selective impressions, and speculative causal claims (e.g. that vagueness causes drift/leaving) without systematic data. Citations to social-movement and decision-making literature are relevant but sparse and not used to test the central hypothesis. Alternative explanations (selection effects, heterogeneity across cause areas, organizational design, publicity effects) are not rigorously ruled out. Overall the thesis is plausible and provocatively argued, but under\u2011supported empirically."

    "validation_notes": "Most of the post\u2019s empirically testable claims are supported by credible sources or community data, though many of the author\u2019s key points are normative or anecdotal rather than purely factual. Supported claims: (a) AI risk / AI safety is one of the most highly prioritized cause areas in EA, especially among highly-engaged members (EA Survey reports AI risk among top-rated causes and high-engagement respondents prioritise AI). (b) AI safety receives substantial concentrated philanthropic funding (Open Philanthropy and other EA-linked funds have made large AI-safety grants). (c) Many prominent AI safety organisations and initiatives are Bay Area / US-based (examples: Redwood Research, ARC, METR/ARC Evals spinouts). (d) EA\u2019s public reputation and community scrutiny shifted after the FTX/Sam Bankman-Fried scandal (major press coverage and discussion; organizations responded). (e) There is not (as of the cited literature) a widely-used GiveWell-style charity evaluator dedicated to AI alignment in the same way GiveWell/ACE serve global health or animal welfare; the EA/AI community has produced charity-comparison reviews but no single dominant, mainstream evaluator equivalent to GiveWell. Partially supported / anecdotal: claims about community \u201ccoldness,\u201d that lack of a mission drives many people away, and that leavers tend to stop thinking about impact are plausible and echoed in forum posts and retention interviews but are based on community surveys/interviews and qualitative reports rather than representative causal evidence. Overall: the post\u2019s empirical claims are generally consistent with EA Survey results, funding reports, retention/attrition analyses, and mainstream press; the normative inferences (that the lack of a concrete mission explains disillusionment) are plausible but not definitively established by the cited data.",
