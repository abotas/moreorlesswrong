    "explanation": "This is a useful, practical question for the EA community rather than a foundational claim. A well\u2011done social\u2011network analysis of EA donors, organizations, and collaborators could meaningfully help with fundraising strategy, identifying bottlenecks and single points of failure, understanding influence pathways, and avoiding duplicated effort \u2014 so it has moderate importance to EA practitioners and organizers. However, the post itself is just a solicitation/idea (not an empirical result), depends heavily on data quality, and raises privacy/misuse risks; it is not load\u2011bearing for EA\u2019s core philosophical or technical claims. For general humanity the impact is negligible except insofar as it indirectly shapes where a subset of philanthropic resources flow."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Missing a concrete research question and operational definitions \u2014 The post treats SNA as a generic good without saying what decisions or insights you want it to enable. That makes scope, data needs, and whether the project is feasible unclear. Actionable fix: pick one narrow, decision\u2011relevant question (e.g., \u201cWhich institutions act as funding intermediaries for EA causes in the US, 2018\u20132023?\u201d) and define nodes and edges precisely (people vs orgs, donation flow vs board ties vs co\u2011funding, how to weight ties). Describe a small, time\u2011bounded pilot rather than an open\u2011ended map. This will also focus ethical choices and data sources. \n\n2) Big ethical, legal and inference risks are not addressed \u2014 Publicly mapping individuals and donor flows can cause harms (doxxing, misattribution), and funding links are often opaque (grants via intermediaries, undisclosed donors), so simple SNA could mislead readers. Actionable fix: add a short ethics section before publishing that (a) lists likely harms, (b) commits to mitigation (aggregate/anonymize individuals, publish uncertainty, avoid identifying small donors, get consent where feasible), and (c) explains limits of inference (public filings only, missing private gifts). Consider focusing on organizational networks (less risky) for the first pass. \n\n3) Overlooks readily available data sources, prior projects and practical constraints \u2014 The post says it hasn\u2019t checked for EA\u2011specific examples but doesn\u2019t cite common SNA tools or philanthropy datasets, which makes duplication more likely and underestimates work needed. Actionable fix: do a quick reconnaissance and either cite or ask about these resources in the post: Candid/Foundation Center/IRS 990 data, OpenPhil/80,000 Hours/EA org lists, GitHub (search for \u201cphilanthropy network\u201d or \u201cfoundation map\u201d), and tools like Gephi, NetworkX, Cytoscape or ORA. Mentioning these will (a) signal you did minimal due diligence, (b) attract more useful replies, and (c) help readers judge feasibility.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback correctly identifies several important gaps the post would benefit from: lack of a concrete, decision\u2011relevant research question and operational definitions (which would focus replies and avoid pointless scope creep), failure to flag ethical/legal/inference risks (which is a real 'own goal' if someone made a public map of donors), and omission of obvious data sources and tools (which makes reinvention more likely). These are critical improvements that would materially raise the quality and safety of the project and attract better responses. It stops short of catching anything that would render the post incoherent or blatantly wrong, so a score below the top end is appropriate."

    "explanation": "Overall very clear and easy to follow: tidy structure (Epistemic status, TL;DR, Context, Question, Disclaimer), useful links, and a focused ask (whether an SNA of EA donors/actors exists). Small weaknesses: minor redundancy and filler language, a confusing line about \u201ctwo reasons\u201d that lists three, a strange LLM footnote, and a few places where scope (e.g. donors vs community members, public vs private data) could be tightened to make the request more concise and actionable."

    "novelty_humanity": 2,
    "explanation": "Applying Social Network Analysis specifically to map EA donors, fund flows, collaborations and bottlenecks is somewhat new within the EA Forum \u2014 people have made EA/AI maps and discussed influence networks, but a formal SNA of EA philanthropy doesn\u2019t appear to be widespread or published on the Forum. However the underlying idea (use SNA to map philanthropic/political networks) is well established in academia, journalism and policy work, so it is not novel to general humanity."

    "overall_support": 3,
    "explanation": "Strengths: The post asks a clear, bounded question, gives useful context (what SNA is, analogous maps for AI/EA), and acknowledges uncertainty and limitations. The logic for why an SNA might be useful (identify funder ties, collaborations, bottlenecks) is reasonable and internally coherent. Weaknesses: This is exploratory rather than argumentative \u2014 it provides no empirical SNA examples or systematic literature search to back the novelty claim, and it doesn\u2019t engage key methodological, ethical, or data\u2011availability challenges (e.g., private donor data, edge definitions). The evidence offered is limited to a general SNA primer and two illustrative maps, which is insufficient to support the claim that no EA\u2011specific SNA exists or that such an analysis would be feasible or high\u2011value. Improvements would include citing previous SNA efforts (if any), outlining feasible data sources and privacy safeguards, and sketching concrete node/edge definitions and metrics."

    "validation_notes": "Strengths: The post's basic description of Social Network Analysis (SNA) is correct and SNA is used in philanthropy and community-mapping work. ([visiblenetworklabs.com](https://visiblenetworklabs.com/2023/01/06/social-network-analysis-for-foundations/?utm_source=openai)) Existential\u2011AI / EA community maps and funding\u2011data projects already exist (e.g., AISafety.com map, the AI\u2011safety ecosystem maps, and several community-maintained EA/org maps), so the claim that no EA\u2011specific examples exist is only partly correct. ([aisafety.com](https://www.aisafety.com/map?utm_source=openai), [resources.eagroups.org](https://resources.eagroups.org/maps-of-ea-orgs?utm_source=openai)) Open datasets that would allow building donor\u2192grantee SNA (e.g., Open Philanthropy\u2019s public grants database) are publicly available, and community \u201cbig funding\u201d spreadsheets / maps have been used to visualise funding relationships in EA-adjacent areas. ([openphilanthropy.org](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/?utm_source=openai), [forum.effectivealtruism.org](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/idyoQvieuXXcspJzh/interactive-ai-governance-map?utm_source=openai)) Weaknesses / caveats: I did not find a widely\u2011cited, peer\u2011reviewed academic SNA study that explicitly models the EA donor\u2192organization network with formal SNA metrics (centrality, weighted funding edges, bottleneck analysis). Projects to date appear to be community maps, interactive directories, and grant databases that are often suitable inputs for SNA but are not always presented as formal SNA analyses. ([bradrfulton.com](https://bradrfulton.com/research/projects/f-g-network/?utm_source=openai), [aisafety.davidveksler.com](https://aisafety.davidveksler.com/?utm_source=openai)) Overall: most factual points in the post are reasonable (definition, examples of maps), but the novelty claim (no EA\u2011specific SNA examples) is overstated given existing community maps and funding datasets \u2014 hence a score of 7 (well\u2011supported for most claims, but not fully validated on the novelty point).",
