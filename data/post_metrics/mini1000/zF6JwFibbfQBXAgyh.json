    "explanation": "This is a low-stakes request for alternative prioritization/resource lists to inform an individual's career planning. It could be moderately useful to a subset of the EA/rationalist community (helping people broaden sources when doing career/problem prioritization), but it doesn't present new arguments or claims that would shift major views or policy. For general humanity it is essentially trivial."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Missing key decision context (values, time horizon, and prioritization criteria). Right now it\u2019s impossible for others to recommend alternative lists because different lists target different questions (short\u2011term vs longtermist risks, philanthropic effectiveness vs policy priorities, global burden vs existential risk). Action: add a one\u2011sentence statement of your values and time horizon and whether you care most about scale/neglectedness/tractability/robustness to uncertainty. That will let responders point to the right kind of lists.\n\n2) Assumes all \u201cproblem prioritization lists\u201d are comparable and equally useful. In practice these lists vary widely in scope, methodology, and assumptions (EA orgs vs academic/global institutions vs UN/WEF reports). Action: ask explicitly whether you want EA\u2011aligned lists only or also mainstream/academic ones, and say whether you prefer lists that include reasoning/methodology or just rankings. This will avoid bad recommendations.\n\n3) No evidence of prior search or desired format, which lowers signal and duplicates effort. Action: briefly list 1\u20132 places you\u2019ve already checked (e.g., only 80k), and say whether you want a short curated list, links, or a synthesis/comparison. Also include preferred channels (EA Forum replies, DMs, Google Drive). That will make replies faster and more targeted.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback identifies the key omissions that materially weaken the post: lack of values/time-horizon/criteria, an implicit assumption that different prioritization lists are comparable, and no sign of prior searching or desired reply format. These are high-impact, actionable fixes that would make replies far more targeted and useful, and they can be implemented with only a sentence or two, so the cost in post length is low. (Not a 9\u201310 because the post isn\u2019t fatally flawed \u2014 it just needs this contextual information.)"

    "explanation": "I have no evidence that a person or pseudonym 'lamparita' is a known figure in the EA/rationalist community or publicly: no prominent publications, talks, or citations are associated with that name in my knowledge.

    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The post is easy to understand, concise, and well-structured: it gives context (80k template), quotes the relevant options, states the plan (mix approaches), and asks a clear question (where to find alternative prioritization lists). It could be made slightly clearer by specifying what kinds of lists are most useful (e.g., EA-aligned, academic, policy-focused) or giving an example of what the asker considers a good alternative, but overall it communicates the request succinctly and effectively."

    "explanation": "This is mainly a straightforward resource request (asking for alternative problem-prioritization lists beyond 80,000 Hours) rather than presenting new ideas or claims. EA readers will find it very familiar and unsurprising\u2014many people in the community have asked for or compiled alternative lists\u2014so it's not novel for that audience. For the general public it's slightly more novel only insofar as the specific context (80k's career template and formal prioritization lists) may be unfamiliar, but the underlying impulse\u2014seeking other expert lists or opinions\u2014is commonplace."

    "explanation": "The post is clear and logically coherent as a request \u2014 it reasonably motivates wanting alternative prioritization lists and correctly references 80k\u2019s guidance. However it does not present an argument or criteria for evaluating alternative lists, and offers no empirical evidence or examples of other lists. Strengths: clarity, sensible motivation. Weaknesses: absence of supporting evidence, no evaluative framework, and no alternatives provided."

    "validation_notes": "The post\u2019s factual claims are minimal and mostly accurate: 80,000 Hours does present the two broad approaches and links the career-planning template to its problem list and a \u2018how to compare problems\u2019 guide \u2014 those pages and wording are verifiable. There are also many alternative problem-prioritization resources (Open Philanthropy cause reports, WEF Global Risks rankings, UN SDGs, Global Priorities Institute research, GiveWell\u2019s charity-focused prioritization), so the author\u2019s request for other lists is reasonable. Minor limitation: the author\u2019s personal statement that they do not know other lists is subjective and not independently verifiable. Overall, core empirical claims check out and alternatives exist, so I deduct only a small amount for the unverifiable personal-knowledge statement.",
