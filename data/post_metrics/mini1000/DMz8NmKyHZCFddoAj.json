    "explanation": "This is a practical, actionable proposal about scaling support for university/city EA groups that could meaningfully improve organiser capacity, recruitment, and retention \u2014 important for field-building but not foundational to EA/AI-safety theory or strategy. If adopted widely it would likely raise the effectiveness and scale of local outreach, but if wrong or ignored the broader EA project is mostly unaffected. For general humanity the impacts are indirect and speculative, so it has very low immediate importance."

    "explanation": "Insufficient evidence of prominence. The handle \"gergo\" (or Gerg\u0151) is common and may be a pseudonym; no widely recognized EA/rationalist leadership, frequent speaking, major publications, or notable online footprint tied to that single name. If you can supply links or context (forum posts, articles, affiliation), I can reassess more accurately."
