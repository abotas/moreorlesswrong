    "explanation": "This is a useful operational update for the EA community about Forum health, features, team capacity and budgetary trade\u2011offs. It matters for community coordination, discourse quality, and participation (e.g. volunteer recruitment, moderation, feature changes), and flags a nontrivial risk if resourcing is cut. However it is not foundational to EA theory, strategy, or high\u2011stakes decisions \u2014 its impact is mostly logistical/organizational rather than world\u2011changing. For the general public it is essentially irrelevant."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Be more specific and transparent about the announced reduction in Forum capacity. Right now you say \u201cwe\u2019ve been spending a smaller portion of our resources\u201d and note a rough FTE/budget estimate in a footnote, but readers will reasonably want: a clear timeline for any further reductions, the decision criteria you\u2019ll use (KPIs/thresholds), and concrete expected impacts (which tasks/features might be deprioritised). Actionable fixes: add a one-paragraph plan that states (a) current vs planned FTE and budget for the Forum over the next 6\u201312 months, (b) the decisions or KPIs that would trigger restoring or further cutting capacity, and (c) the specific features/activities that are most at risk. This reduces speculation and trust loss.  \n\n2) Provide a concrete mitigation plan for moderation/operational gaps instead of mainly soliciting volunteers. You note weekend capacity problems and ask for facilitators, but don\u2019t say how volunteers will be onboarded, supervised, or what minimum commitment is required \u2014 which makes volunteering unattractive and leaves the community wondering how you\u2019ll keep quality consistent. Actionable fixes: state the expected weekly hours for a facilitator, the onboarding timeline (e.g., 1\u20132 hour live onboarding + checklist), quality controls (who reviews flags, SLAs), whether any paid/backup coverage is planned, and target number of volunteers needed to cover weekends. If you\u2019re unwilling to staff weekends, say so and explain the contingency plan.  \n\n3) Add concrete usage metrics and early evaluation of recent feature changes. Saying metrics are \u201cpretty stable\u201d and listing features is useful, but readers will expect evidence that changes are working or not (e.g., retention, DAU/MAU, posts/comments/karma trends, results from notification changes or draft-comments rollout). Actionable fixes: include 2\u20134 headline numbers (baseline and current), an explanation of how you measure success for recent changes, and any early qualitative feedback or A/B test results. If you don\u2019t have those numbers or tests, say that explicitly and commit to publishing them in the next update.  \n\nThese three changes would greatly reduce uncertainty for the community, make the post more trustworthy, and turn vague worries into concrete, testable commitments \u2014 while keeping the post short and actionable.",
    "improvement_potential": "Targets three high-value omissions: vague statements about reduced capacity, lack of a concrete moderation/backup plan, and absence of hard usage/impact metrics. These are likely to cause community distrust and speculation (an \"own goal\") and are reasonably fixable with brief, specific additions, so implementing them would substantially improve the post. It loses a couple points because some info (rough FTE/budget) is already present in a footnote and because fully answering the requests may require coordination outside a single update."

    "explanation": "Well-structured and easy to follow: clear headings, chronological sections, concrete links and calls to action make the post highly comprehensible. The main message (team reprioritisation, feature updates, events, volunteer ask) is presented logically and supported with specifics. Weaknesses: it's a bit long and occasionally repetitive, some important implications of reduced capacity are only hedged rather than concretely explained, and footnotes/metrics jargon (FTE, budget numbers) may slow readers unfamiliar with them."

    "explanation": "This is primarily an operational/product update for a community platform \u2014 routine feature releases (notifications, drafts, polls), event recaps, team changes, and volunteer asks. The only slightly uncommon content for readers is the candid note about shifting resourcing (estimated FTE/budget and risk of reduced value), but that\u2019s still familiar territory for EA Forum regulars. For the general public, nothing here is conceptually new \u2014 it reads like a typical community/org status update."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post is clear, transparent about changes, links to prior posts and code/feature notes, and gives concrete operational details (FTE, budget, feature rollouts, event outcomes). The narrative about shifting priorities and the warning that reduced capacity could harm the Forum is plausible and internally consistent. Weaknesses: The post makes empirical claims (e.g. \"usage metrics have been pretty stable\" and \"we got more posts than before\") without presenting detailed, disaggregated data, statistical context, or causal analysis. There is limited quantitative evidence for claims about user engagement, impact of features, or the tradeoffs of reallocating capacity. That makes the conclusions moderately supported but not strongly evidenced."

Sarah Cheng\u2019s January 2025 post documents the prior 2024 decline in Forum metrics and the June 2025 update states metrics have been \u201cpretty stable\u201d since January \u2014 these are internal analytics claims (primary-source but not fully independently reproducible). Independent traffic estimators (SimilarWeb / site-analytics summaries) and the Forum\u2019s own 2023 user-survey give corroborating context for overall usage trends, but they don\u2019t fully confirm the exact numeric claims or the author\u2019s internal budget/FTE breakdown (~2.5 FTE, ~$1.3M budget, ~$600k cost), which appear to be the author\u2019s internal estimates and are not externally verifiable. Overall: well-supported for feature/event/team claims; partially supported for usage-trend claims; internal budget/FTE numbers are claims of the author and not independently confirmed.",
