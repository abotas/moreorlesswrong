    "explanation": "This is a personal career-advice request from a student choosing A\u2011levels; it has limited broader epistemic or policy significance. It may matter modestly to the EA community insofar as talent development and recruitment are relevant, and is valuable for the individual, but it is not a load-bearing argument or novel claim that would change major decisions or worldviews. For general humanity it is essentially trivial."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Big implicit assumption: creative subjects = low-impact. This is a large, unjustified claim and it shapes the whole post. Many high\u2011impact roles use creativity (design, UX/HCI, product design, science communication, public engagement, policy communications, social entrepreneurship, architecture, industrial design, some AI alignment and biosecurity roles require creative thinking). Action: replace the blanket claim with a sentence asking whether you can tolerate combining creative subjects with STEM/technical skills, and give 1\u20132 example career combos you\u2019d consider (e.g. Maths + Art \u2192 UX/Product Design; Computer Science + Music \u2192 audio/ML engineering, etc.) so responders can offer tailored advice.  \n\n2) Missing essential constraints and concrete options. You ask \u201cwhat should I do?\u201d but don\u2019t say which A\u2011levels you\u2019re actually deciding between, whether you plan to go to university, how willing you are to study STEM, or how important keeping options open is. Those details are necessary for useful answers. Action: add 1\u20132 lines listing the subjects you can choose from and your true preferences/risk tolerance (e.g. \u201cI can pick 3 of: Maths, Further Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Art, Music; I\u2019m open to uni and switching disciplines later\u201d). If you want short advice, ask specifically for A\u2011level combinations that keep high\u2011impact career options open while letting you keep a creative outlet.  \n\n3) Overlooks straightforward, low\u2011cost ways to explore impact before locking in choices. You treat A\u2011levels as a binding gamble; that\u2019s misleading. You can test interests and build transferable skills now. Action: mention you haven\u2019t tried these and ask whether you should (and which): take free online courses (intro CS, data, design), build small projects/portfolio, do an EPQ or summer internships, talk to teachers/mentors, read 80,000 Hours and EA Forum career guides, attend local EA/volunteering events. This makes responses much more actionable and reduces the pressure to \u201cpick the perfect A\u2011levels\u201d now.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback targets the post's biggest mistaken assumption (that creative subjects imply low impact), points out missing crucial details (which A\u2011levels are available, uni plans, STEM willingness) and gives practical, low\u2011cost alternatives to lock\u2011in decisions. These are high\u2011value, actionable critiques that would materially improve replies. It loses a bit of extra value by not briefly mentioning tone/reassurance or suggesting the author state constraints succinctly, so it\u2019s not quite a perfect 10."

    "clarity_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The post is generally easy to understand: it gives relevant background (GCSE results, need to pick A\u2011levels), a clear goal (wanting to prepare for an altruistic career) and the main tension (logical/problem\u2011solving skills vs creative interests). Weaknesses: some repetition and a small typo ('impass' -> 'impasse'), and the exact request is a bit vague \u2014 it doesn't specify constraints, priorities, or what kinds of suggestions would be most helpful, which weakens the argumentative focus."

    "explanation": "This is a very familiar type of post for EA readers \u2014 student career/advice threads about choosing subjects to 'maximise positive output' are common. The only mildly novel elements are the UK-specific A\u2011level context and the explicit tension between creative interests (art/music) and wanting to have large-scale altruistic impact, but overall the ideas are routine and widely discussed."

    "explanation": "Strengths: clear self-assessment (academic ability, skills, creative interests) and a reasonable goal (preparing for an altruistic career). Weaknesses: arguments rest on unstated/unsupported assumptions (e.g. that art and music have little scope for large positive impact), little analysis of feasible paths or trade-offs, no explicit criteria for choosing A\u2011levels, and no empirical or external evidence. Overall the post raises sensible questions but offers limited reasoning and no evidence to support its implicit claims or proposed course of action."

    "validation_notes": "Most of the post is subjective/personal (predicted grades, feelings, preferences) and therefore not verifiable. Two empirical claims can be checked: (1) that choosing A\u2011levels matters for future study/career \u2014 well supported by UK university admissions guidance (Russell Group/UCAS) and advice that \u2018facilitating\u2019 subjects keep options open; (2) the claim that creative subjects (art/music) have little scope for large positive impact \u2014 this is an overly narrow view and not supported by evidence: research (WHO) shows arts can produce substantial public\u2011health and wellbeing benefits, and UK government data show the creative industries make large economic and social contributions. EA/charity advice (80,000 Hours, GiveWell) shows many high\u2011impact career paths favour quantitative/technical skills but also highlights roles (communications, advocacy, creative public engagement) where creative skills amplify impact. Overall: factual claims about A\u2011levels are supported; the dismissal of creative subjects as low\u2011impact is contradicted by multiple sources; personal predictions and preferences are unverifiable.",
