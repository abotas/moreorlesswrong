    "explanation": "This is a short, personal-post about post-conference implementation block. It\u2019s not making foundational claims or novel arguments, so it\u2019s low-stakes for EA theory or strategy. It has modest practical value for community members who run projects or attend events (shared experience, potential coping strategies, community norms), but it wouldn\u2019t materially change major decisions or long-term priorities. For humanity at large it\u2019s trivial."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Be specific about the project and status so readers can help: state one-sentence summary of the project/activities you wanted to implement, list the 2\u20134 concrete tasks you expected to finish after EAG, the timeframe you had in mind, and what you\u2019ve already tried. Without that context responses will be generic.  \n2) Offer plausible diagnoses and a focused ask: briefly propose 2\u20133 reasons you think this is happening (e.g. burnout, decision paralysis/perfectionism, overwhelmed by next steps, lack of external deadlines) and then ask for one kind of help (practical tips, accountability partner, templates/scripts, or introductions). Targeted questions get actionable answers.  \n3) Give a small, concrete next step to drive engagement: commit to a tiny, time-boxed task (e.g. \u201cI\u2019ll write a 100-word update by Monday\u201d) and invite readers to opt in to a specific support role (30-min accountability call, quick review of a follow-up email, or reply with one-sentence advice). This turns sympathy into actionable support and reduces cognitive overhead for helpers.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback pinpoints the main weaknesses: the post is too vague (no project details or concrete asks) and so will attract generic, low-value replies. The three suggestions (add one-sentence project/status, propose likely diagnoses + a single focused ask, and commit to a tiny next step/invite a specific support role) are practical, concise, and would substantially increase the usefulness of responses without much extra length. Minor caveat: it\u2019s somewhat prescriptive for a casual check\u2011in, but overall these changes are high-impact and correct important omissions."

    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The post is concise, easy to understand, and clearly states the issue and a simple request for others' experiences and solutions. It uses relatable language and is well structured. It loses a bit of clarity by using a novel term ('implementers block') without definition and by not giving concrete examples or context about what specifically is blocking progress, so readers may be unsure how to respond or how severe the issue is."

    "explanation": "This post describes a common experience (post-conference inertia/\u2018implementation\u2019 or founder\u2019s block and overwhelm) and asks for coping strategies. EA readers will recognize the specific context (EAG, project implementation) but the core idea is familiar in the community; for the general public it\u2019s very ordinary and widely discussed. There\u2019s no clearly new conceptual claim or novel solution suggested."

    "explanation": "This is a brief, coherent personal report and question but contains little structured reasoning or argumentation about causes or solutions. It relies entirely on anecdote (no empirical evidence, data, or references) and doesn't explore alternative explanations or testable hypotheses. Strengths: clear, relatable, invites community input. Weaknesses: lacks systematic analysis, evidence, or concrete proposals to evaluate."

    "validation_notes": "Mixed / uncertain. Verifiable facts: EA Global (EAG) London is a real recurring event (CEA runs EA Global: London). Psychological literature strongly supports an intention\u2192action gap (people often fail to follow through) and shows that forming concrete implementation intentions substantially increases follow-through. Procrastination/overwhelm are well-studied and common. Not verifiable: the author\u2019s private report (their own failure to follow up, feelings of an \u201cimplementer\u2019s/founder\u2019s block\u201d) is anecdotal and cannot be independently confirmed. Also, there is no established clinical/academic term \u201cimplementer\u2019s block\u201d or \u201cfounder\u2019s block\u201d widely used in the literature; most evidence on post\u2011conference follow\u2011up rates comes from practitioner articles and surveys rather than large, peer\u2011reviewed prevalence studies.",
