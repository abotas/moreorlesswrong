    "explanation": "This is a useful, timely piece of field\u2011building / meta\u2011research that would materially help funders, researchers, and policy actors in the EA/AI\u2011safety ecosystem to prioritise research on digital sentience and avoid conceptual confusion. It is not themselves a foundational theoretical or empirical advance \u2014 its conclusions mainly affect coordination, framing, and funding choices \u2014 so it is moderately important within EA (could change research agendas and reduce wasted effort) but has limited direct impact on broader humanity unless it leads to downstream policy or technical shifts. The ultimate value depends on uptake, methodological rigor, and whether identified gaps point to high\u2011leverage interventions."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Define \"digital sentience\" and coding/selection rules up front \u2014 The whole project hinges on what counts as sentience (phenomenal consciousness, access consciousness, moral patienthood, behavioural proxies, etc.). The proposal currently treats the concept as self\u2011evident. Actionable fixes: (a) add a short working definition with alternative definitions you will track, (b) create a coding taxonomy (e.g. definitions used, claimed indicators, normative stance) and list clear inclusion/exclusion rules and boundary cases (e.g. LLMs, embodied robots, simulated agents, animal-comparison papers). This will make your mapping interpretable and prevent apples\u2011to\u2011oranges clustering. \n\n2) Make the methodology reproducible and pre\u2011specified to avoid selection bias \u2014 The methods section is high level and lacks search strings, databases, time windows, language scope, handling of grey literature, and inter\u2011coder reliability procedures. That invites cherry\u2011picking and will reduce uptake by funders. Actionable fixes: (a) commit to a PRISMA\u2011style protocol or short pre-registration describing databases (Scopus, Web of Science, arXiv, SSRN, legal databases), search terms and filters, and date/language limits; (b) publish your codebook and inclusion criteria and report inter\u2011coder agreement (or plan for double coding a seed set); (c) specify bibliometric tools/algorithms you will use (citation network methods, topic modeling, bibliometrix/VOSviewer, manual thematic coding) and how you\u2019ll combine quantitative and qualitative results. \n\n3) Strengthen plans for expert validation and realistic resourcing/timeline \u2014 Mapping a multi\u2011disciplinary, contested field as a solo lead in a ~4 month window risks superficiality. The plan underweights expert disagreement and the political/normative sensitivity of the topic. Actionable fixes: (a) add an advisory panel or a small pool of paid consultants (philosophy of mind, neuroscience, ML, legal scholars) and commit to a structured validation step (e.g. targeted interviews or a Delphi round) to check your clusters and recommendations; (b) either extend the timeline or scope down to a pilot (e.g. two disciplines + grey literature) and describe criteria for scaling up. These steps will increase credibility and reduce the chance you produce an unusable or contested synthesis.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback identifies major, practical weaknesses: ambiguous core concept (what counts as 'digital sentience'), underspecified methodology (risk of selection/cherry\u2011picking), and unrealistic resourcing/timeline for a contested interdisciplinary mapping. Fixing these would materially increase credibility and uptake by funders and reduce embarrassment over obvious methodological gaps; they can be addressed without derailing the project but are essential for the proposal to be persuasive."

    "explanation": "Well-structured and readable: clear sections (exec summary, problem, objectives, methods, timeline, risks) make the purpose and deliverables easy to follow. Strengths include explicit outcomes, a plausible methodology, and sensible milestones. Weaknesses: lacks an operational definition of \u201cdigital sentience,\u201d specific inclusion/exclusion criteria and coding/validation procedures, and concrete evaluation metrics; a few sentences are a bit verbose/redundant and the timeline may be optimistic for a solo lead. Addressing those would raise clarity and persuasiveness."

    "explanation": "For EA Forum readers: modest novelty. The topic (digital/AI sentience) and the need for interdisciplinary synthesis are well\u2011known within EA/longtermist and AI\u2011safety circles, and several related literature reviews and roadmaps already exist; the proposal\u2019s particular angle (bibliometric + qualitative landscape mapping aimed at funders) is useful but not highly original. For the general public: moderately novel. A typical educated person has heard about AI sentience in the abstract but is unlikely to have seen a structured, interdisciplinary literature\u2011mapping project with open datasets, visual maps, and funder\u2011focused strategic recommendations \u2014 that applied, methodical framing is relatively new to non\u2011specialists."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The proposal is logically structured and coherent \u2014 clear motivation, objectives, methods, deliverables, timeline, and risk mitigation. The argument that interdisciplinary fragmentation hampers progress and that a landscape mapping would be useful is plausible and well articulated. Methodological choices (bibliometrics + qualitative coding + synthesis) are appropriate for the goals. Weaknesses: The post provides little empirical evidence that the problem is as urgent or as fragmented as claimed (no pilot data, stakeholder needs assessment, or examples from the sentience literature). Cited references are mostly methodological precedents or adjacent topics rather than direct evidence about digital sentience scholarship. Important details are missing (inclusion/exclusion criteria, sampling strategy, specific coding scheme, metrics of success), and the timeline and single\u2011researcher execution raise feasibility concerns. Overall: A well-reasoned and promising project design but under\u2011evidenced and underspecified in key empirical and operational aspects, supporting a moderate confidence in the thesis."

    "validation_notes": "Overall the post\u2019s empirical claims are largely supported. The cited methodological precedents (Mardiani & Iswahyudi 2023; Bralin et al. 2024; Misiejuk et al. mapping work; Maas 2023) are real and appropriate examples of bibliometric / literature\u2011mapping and governance review work. The claim that the research landscape on digital sentience is fragmented and interdisciplinary is well supported by recent reviews and surveys (e.g., Butlin et al. 2023, Chalmers 2023, Sentience Institute AIMS) and by literature reviews that highlight conceptual fragmentation in AI governance. Longview Philanthropy\u2019s active funding programs for \u201cdigital sentience\u201d (fellowships, RFPs, consortium) corroborate the author\u2019s statement about funder interest. The author\u2019s EA Forum identity and prior Aletheia proposal are publicly visible. Weaknesses / uncertainties: (1) the citation \u201cEyal (2021): Legal, regulatory, and normative analysis of AI personhood from a U.S. law perspective\u201d could not be reliably located in that exact form (I could not find a clear public record matching that exact author/year/title), so that item needs verification or a corrected citation; (2) the claim that \u201cno comprehensive landscape mapping exists\u201d is defensible as an interpretive claim (many focused reviews exist, but a single, cross\u2011disciplinary, field\u2011building mapping focused specifically on digital sentience is not obvious in the literature as of mid\u20112025), though evidence shows several recent systematic reviews and indicator\u2011based assessments are emerging. Given those caveats, the proposal\u2019s empirical grounding is good but not flawless.",
