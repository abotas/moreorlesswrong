    "explanation": "For the EA/rationalist community this is moderately important: it concerns inclusivity and movement-building, and if the $5 minimum meaningfully excludes potential future donors in low\u2011income countries it could reduce diversity, engagement, and the habit formation that supports long\u2011term giving. However, it isn't load\u2011bearing for core EA conclusions or high\u2011stakes cause prioritisation (the direct financial impact of loosening the limit is likely small, and there are technical reasons\u2014transaction fees, fraud, currency conversion\u2014that often motivate such limits). For general humanity the issue is low importance: it affects a narrow operational policy and small donations rather than major outcomes, though tiny changes could have modest local community benefits."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) You haven\u2019t investigated or explained the most likely reasons for a $5 minimum (payment-processor fees, fraud / chargeback risk, admin/tax/receipt constraints, currency-conversion limits). Before asking for a policy change, check/Gather and report the precise error message, what payment method and currency you used, and ask GWWC (or check their FAQ) whether this is a deliberate policy or a technical/payment-processor limit. Actionable change for the post: add the exact screenshot text, the payment option you tried, and a sentence asking GWWC to confirm why $5 is required.\n\n2) The ask is framed as if lowering the minimum is cost-free and obviously desirable, but you don\u2019t show demand or consider trade-offs. Strengthen the post by (a) briefly estimating how many students in your group would give (and typical amounts), (b) noting typical transaction costs that make micro-donations expensive for platforms, and (c) proposing concrete, low-cost alternatives rather than only asking for a policy change (e.g., pooled/group treasuries that aggregate many < $5 gifts into one donation, a micro-donation pool GWWC could implement, or guidance on charities/platforms that accept local-currency/mobile payments). This keeps the ask realistic and gives platform staff practical options to consider.\n\n3) You overlook immediately actionable alternatives donors can use now. Readers (and GWWC staff) will find the post more useful if you add one or two tested workarounds you tried or will try: donating directly on the charity\u2019s site (some accept smaller amounts), collecting group donations and making a single $5+ transfer, asking whether crypto or local payment rails are accepted, or whether any EA funds accept smaller one-off contributions. Actionable change: add a short \u201cWhat I tried / will try next\u201d section and invite people with experience of low-value international donations to share specific platform names and workflows.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback correctly identifies key omissions that weaken the post: the author didn\u2019t check or report the technical/policy reason for the $5 floor (payment processor, currency, fraud, receipts), didn\u2019t quantify demand or acknowledge transaction-cost trade-offs, and omitted immediate workarounds. Fixing these would materially increase the post\u2019s credibility and usefulness without greatly lengthening it (add a screenshot/payment-method note, a brief \u2018what I tried\u2019 section, a one-sentence estimate of likely donor numbers/amounts, and one or two concrete alternatives such as pooled/group donations or specific low-fee rails). These are practical, non-trivial issues the author should address before asking for a platform policy change, so the feedback is highly valuable."

    "explanation": "Overall very clear: the post is well-structured, provides relevant local context and concrete asks (allow smaller minimums, add orgs), and invites feedback. Strengths include clear motivation, supporting data, and a concise call-to-action. Minor weaknesses: a small amount of repetition (emphasis on being a student), absent mention of likely causes of the $5 floor (e.g., transaction fees) or a suggested alternative minimum, and slightly unnecessary inline images \u2014 fixing those would make it even tighter and more compelling."

    "explanation": "For EA Forum readers this is low-novelty \u2014 accessibility and payment/transaction barriers, inclusion of low-income donors, and debates about minimum donation thresholds have come up before in EA and charity-platform discussions. The most original element is the specific student/Nigerian perspective and the plea to adapt GWWC for micro-donors, but the underlying points are familiar. For the general public it is moderately novel: many people intuitively know of donation platforms but fewer have thought through how fixed minimums systematically exclude very low-income potential donors or about habit-building via very small one-time gifts."

    "overall_support": 4,
    "explanation": "Strengths: The post presents a clear, coherent argument from lived experience, situates the claim with country-level cost context, and acknowledges uncertainties (e.g. platform rationale). Weaknesses: It is mostly anecdotal and lacks systematic data (no user counts, no platform/transaction-fee analysis, no evidence that lowering the minimum would increase long-term giving), and the income/student figures are thinly sourced. Overall, the claim that a $5 floor creates a meaningful barrier for some donors is plausible and worth investigating, but the current post provides limited empirical support and misses key counterfactuals and operational constraints."

    "validation_notes": "Mostly supported but not fully verifiable. The author\u2019s core factual points are plausible and mostly backed by reliable sources: Numbeo\u2019s Nigeria average monthly net salary (~$128\u2013$130) matches the post\u2019s $130\u2013$150 figure; reporting and student-stipend programs (e.g., NELFUND N20,000 monthly upkeep) and first\u2011hand accounts indicate many Nigerian students subsist on low monthly sums (tens of dollars), consistent with the author\u2019s $20\u2013$50 claim. The EA Forum post (and its screenshots) documents the author\u2019s experience of a $5 minimum on the Giving What We Can (GWWC) donation flow and GWWC commenters/staff discuss the $5 threshold and transaction\u2011cost rationale \u2014 but I could not find a public GWWC help page or formal policy explicitly stating a $5 minimum (the GWWC donation page doesn\u2019t list a minimum). That leaves the \u201cGWWC enforces a $5 minimum\u201d claim reasonably credible (supported by the forum thread and screenshots) but not conclusively proven by an official GWWC public statement. There is also corroborating evidence that some charities/payment flows effectively impose small minimums (or processors do), and that some EA\u2011recommended charities (e.g., Against Malaria Foundation) accept small online donations, so alternatives may exist. Main weaknesses: no explicit public GWWC policy page confirming the $5 minimum; student allowance figures vary widely by region and program.",
