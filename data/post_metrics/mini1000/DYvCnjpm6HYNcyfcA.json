    "explanation": "A credible global tax + governing institution would be transformative if achievable: it could eliminate much extreme poverty, curb wealth concentration, change geopolitical incentives, and materially affect existential-risk mitigation. That makes the idea high-impact in principle for all humanity. For the EA/rationalist community it is moderately-to-strongly important because it intersects with longtermist governance strategy and normative priorities, but it is neither novel nor immediately load-bearing for most EA interventions (and faces severe legal and political feasibility hurdles). The post is useful as brainstorming that could spur useful discussion, but it lacks the technical/legal detail and realism needed to be foundational."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Overstates legal/operational feasibility of a unilateral \u201cglobal tax.\u201d Major mistake: you treat a worldwide wealth tax as something that can be created without state consent or without solving tax\u2011avoidance/enforcement. ICJ or human\u2011rights lawsuits are very unlikely to impose new taxing powers on states; international law typically requires treaties or states\u2019 domestic legislation, and the rich can and will shift assets if enforcement is weak. Actionable fix: cut the speculative legal route and replace it with a realistic pathway section \u2014 e.g. (a) study existing multilateral models (OECD/G20 minimum tax, FATCA/CRS information exchange, EU/IMF fiscal cooperation), (b) emphasize treaty-based approaches or coalitions of the willing (plurality of states passing harmonised laws), and (c) consult tax\u2011policy and international\u2011law experts and cite precedents.  \n\n2) Missing hard numbers and behavioral responses \u2014 \u201ctax the richest 10%\u201d is too vague and lets readers assume implausible revenue and compliance. You need to define who is taxed (global top 10% by income or wealth?), what tax base and rates (including progressive/exponential schedule), and estimate revenues net of evasion and avoidance. Actionable fix: add a short modelling requirement to the post: (a) provide or cite crude revenue estimates for plausible parameter choices, (b) discuss likely avoidance responses (capital flight, tax havens) and enforcement costs, and (c) show what fraction of a global basic income that revenue could realistically finance. If you don\u2019t want to model yourself, ask for collaborators or link to Tax Justice Network/OECD estimates.  \n\n3) Understates governance, legitimacy and capture risks of a new global institution. Big own goal: assuming an imposed global redistributor would act \u201cfor the majority\u201d ignores risks of elite capture, lack of democratic legitimacy, and enforcement abuse. Actionable fix: add a short section listing institutional safeguards required (transparent funding flows, democratic representation or global citizen assembly input, independent oversight and audit, sunset clauses, appeals mechanisms, anti\u2011capture measures), and propose an incremental pilot approach (regional agreements, targeted global levies like a digital services tax or carbon pricing ringfence, or a trust fund seeded by high\u2011net\u2011worth donations) rather than an immediate universal global government. Also add concrete actor contacts/readings (Tax Justice Network, IMF fiscal papers, OECD BEPS documents, examples of regional fiscal integration) to make the post more actionable for readers.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback correctly identifies the post\u2019s major own\u2011goals (treating a unilateral global tax as legally/operationally feasible, lacking revenue/behavioural modelling, and underestimating capture/legitimacy risks). It gives concrete, actionable fixes and cites realistic alternative pathways (treaty\u2011based coalitions, OECD/G20 precedents, modelling, safeguards, pilots). Addressing these points would substantially improve the post and avoid embarrassing errors; only minor additional topics (e.g., political coalition\u2011building tactics or more specific precedent examples) could make it perfect."

    "explanation": "I cannot find a clearly identifiable EA/rationalist author known simply as 'Janika' \u2014 the name may be a pseudonym or ambiguous. There is no obvious public profile, publications, or talks linking a single notable figure by that name, so they appear unknown in EA circles and have no measurable global fame.

    "post_id": "DYvCnjpm6HYNcyfcA",
    "clarity_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The post is generally easy to understand: it states a clear problem (global inequality), a concrete vision (global tax on the richest 10%, basic income, and a global monitoring/aid institution), and specific questions about legal and political pathways. Strengths: readable structure, clear goals, and concrete asks. Weaknesses: some vagueness about mechanisms (how the tax would be implemented, who would enforce it), occasional grammatical/slightly rambling sentences, and a broad scope that makes the argument less precise \u2014 it could be tighter and more specific about feasible next steps or target audiences."

    "explanation": "Most elements of the post (global wealth tax, funding a basic income, UN reform/global governance, using redistribution to reduce inequality and address longterm risks, Singer-style moral framing) are long-standing topics in EA and related literatures, so for EA Forum readers this is not very novel. Slightly less common is the specific framing of a global tax targeted at the top 10% with an exponential schedule plus the concrete question about legal routes (e.g. suing at international courts) to create such an institution \u2014 but even those ideas have been discussed in policy and academic debates. For the general educated public the combination and institutional/legal focus is moderately novel: many people have heard of taxing the rich or global institutions, but fewer have considered detailed proposals for a global tax mechanism, a global basic income, or legal pathways to create supranational redistribution."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post identifies a real, important problem (global inequality, political capture by the wealthy) and sketches a coherent high\u2011level solution (global tax + institution, basic income, monitoring). It also correctly flags political resistance as a major obstacle. Weaknesses: Arguments are largely speculative and underdeveloped \u2014 key issues such as enforcement, jurisdiction, sovereign consent, incentive effects, capital flight/tax avoidance, and realistic pathways to institutional creation are not analyzed. No empirical evidence, precedents, legal analysis, or citations are provided to support feasibility claims. Overall, the idea has moral appeal but is poorly supported in argumentation and lacks any empirical or legal grounding; substantial further research (legal feasibility, political economy, precedent cases, and incremental strategies) would be required to make a persuasive case."

    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 7,
    "validation_notes": "Strengths: The post\u2019s core empirical claims are largely supported by evidence \u2014 (a) the world currently produces enough food and (in principle) global income is sufficient to eliminate extreme poverty, subject to distribution and logistical constraints, (b) inequality is associated with political influence by elites and with social/political instability, and (c) governments face real pressures (lobbying, tax\u2011competition) that make wealthy interests politically powerful. Weaknesses / limits: the policy/legal claims are more speculative. A binding global tax or a global government with authority to tax and forcibly redistribute would require new treaties or near\u2011universal state consent and major enforcement solutions; it is not legally achievable today by unilateral lawsuit or individual action at the ICJ/ICC. Recent policy proposals (e.g., a global minimum tax on corporations, or proposals for a global minimum tax on billionaires) show international cooperation is possible but politically difficult and technically complex. Overall: most factual premises are well\u2011supported, but the feasibility of creating an enforceable global income/wealth tax and a global coercive redistributive institution without state consent is weak/unsupported by current international law.",
