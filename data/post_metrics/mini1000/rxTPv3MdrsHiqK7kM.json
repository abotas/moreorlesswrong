    "explanation": "Useful, well-sourced synthesis that meaningfully clarifies why global malaria cases plateaued/rose (population growth, stalled funding, and insecticide resistance). For the EA/community focused on global health giving and priority-setting this is fairly load\u2011bearing \u2014 it affects cost\u2011effectiveness judgements, procurement and advocacy choices (e.g., support for next\u2011gen nets, renewed funding). It is not definitive or foundational research (author is a non\u2011expert and uses crude assumptions), so it should inform but not overturn high\u2011stakes decisions without corroboration from malaria experts and primary analyses. For general humanity the post is of moderate importance: it highlights policy\u2011relevant causes and solutions, but doesn\u2019t by itself change broad public policy or scientific understanding."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Don\u2019t present precise quantitative attribution (the Shapley percentages) from the current toy model. Your spreadsheet rests on several acknowledged-but-very-strong assumptions (linear relationship between net use and cases, arbitrary $/net and 4:1 funding-to-nets conversion, crude mapping of resistance \u2192 efficacy). Those assumptions make the 34%/27%/39% split essentially meaningless and liable to mislead readers. Actionable fix: remove or heavily qualify the exact percentages (e.g., call them \u201cillustrative\u201d and give wide uncertainty ranges), or\u2014better\u2014replace the single-point Shapley results with a brief sensitivity analysis showing how results change when you vary the 2\u20133 most important assumptions (slope of net-use \u2192 cases, net cost premium, funding\u2192nets conversion). If you keep numbers, show ranges not point estimates and flag them prominently as speculative.  \n\n2) Address data and surveillance confounders and the WHO/IMHE discrepancy more explicitly. You rely on WHO modeled case counts but don\u2019t discuss uncertainty in those estimates or possible changes in surveillance/reporting, testing rates (RDT usage), treatment-seeking, or diagnostic criteria since 2015 \u2014 any of which could affect reported/modelled case trends. Similarly, IMHE vs WHO spending differences could reflect methodology, scope (NGOs, private spending), or lags rather than true stagnation. Actionable fix: add a short section (3\u20135 sentences) that (a) reports uncertainty around WHO case estimates (cite confidence/uncertainty intervals or emphasize they\u2019re modeled), (b) notes whether testing/reporting coverage or RDT positivity changed over the period (or state that you checked and couldn\u2019t find a clear change), and (c) briefly explain possible reasons for the IMHE/WHO funding divergence. If possible, run a simple robustness check: compare WHO case trends to an alternative outcome such as parasite prevalence (Malaria Atlas Project) or test-positivity where available, and report whether the broad pattern (decline to 2015, flat after) holds.  \n\n3) Strengthen or tone down the PFAS / experimental-hut / resistance evidence\u2014right now the literature search and inference are too thin to support firm claims. You performed a quick Google Scholar sweep and then extrapolated cone/hut trial results (and a single PNG paper) to population-level effects. Experimental hut and cone tests do not map cleanly to epidemiological impact without modeling (and results vary widely by site, vector species, and net age). Actionable fix: either (A) substantially bolster this section by doing a more systematic search (or citing existing systematic reviews/meta-analyses, WHO technical guidance, and the recent PermaNet/IVCC/AMF/WHO communications) and explicitly assessing geographic representativeness and temporal coverage; or (B) tone down the PFAS/PermaNet claims to emphasize they are preliminary lab/field test signals that require triangulation with community-level impact studies or transmission models. Consider contacting a malaria entomologist or referencing recent RCTs/meta-analyses (e.g., Cochrane, recent dual\u2011AI trials) before making causal claims about PFAS removal or net cohort effects.",
    "improvement_potential": "The three suggestions target the post\u2019s biggest weak spots: presenting spurious precision from a toy model, under-addressing uncertainty and surveillance/reporting confounders in WHO/IMHE data, and over-interpreting thin PFAS/experimental-hut evidence. Fixing (1) alone would eliminate a clear \u2018own-goal\u2019 (precise Shapley splits based on admitted unrealistic assumptions). Adding the short robustness checks and stronger caveats or a toned-down PFAS section would materially raise the post\u2019s credibility without requiring a huge rewrite."

    "explanation": "The post is well structured, accessible to non\u2011experts, and transparent about sources, methods, and uncertainties \u2014 the summary, clear headings, and step\u2011by\u2011step evidence for each factor make the main points easy to follow. Weaknesses: it is long and occasionally verbose, some technical sections (models, assumptions, the crude attribution exercise) are dense and rely on rough or undocumented choices, and a few informal asides slightly reduce the perceived rigor. Overall it communicates its argument clearly but could be tightened and made more concise in places."

    "explanation": "Most of the post\u2019s core claims (stagnant funding, insecticide resistance reducing net effectiveness, and large African population growth driving absolute case numbers) are already well-known among EA/ global-health readers and malaria researchers. The value is mainly in the clear, synthetic write-up and the crude quantitative attribution (BOTEC/Shapley-style) rather than in a fundamentally new mechanism. The more novel elements are (a) the specific dive into the 2012 PFAS/coating change on PermaNet and its imperfect correspondence between cone vs. hut/field results, (b) the use of simple transmission models to think through how population growth affects per-capita vs. absolute cases, and (c) the explicit combined accounting (and rough % attribution) of the three factors. Those details make the post moderately novel to a general educated audience but only mildly novel to EA Forum readers."

    "explanation": "Strengths: clear, well-structured argument; cites reputable data sources (WHO, IMHE, DHS, Malaria Atlas, RCTs, experimental-hut studies); transparently states assumptions and uncertainties; plausible multi-factor causal story (population, funding, resistance). Weaknesses: key causal links are not rigorously established (mostly correlational / modeled), the botec attribution is ad hoc and relies on strong/simplifying assumptions (e.g. linear effects of net use on cases); literature review of net efficacy and resistance is limited and focused on specific products/locations; some country-level inconsistencies are noted but not systematically analyzed. Result: a plausible, cautiously argued thesis with decent supporting evidence but substantial remaining uncertainty and need for more rigorous, systematic causal analysis."

    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 7,
    "validation_notes": "Most major empirical claims in the post are supported by high\u2011quality sources: WHO data show global malaria cases declined 2000\u20132015 then stalled/rose (2019\u20132023) and the African burden dominates; Africa/sub\u2011Saharan Africa populations grew ~70\u201380% since 2000; international malaria financing rose sharply in the 2000s and flattened/plateaued after ~2010 (IHME/WHO/Haakenstad); pyrethroid resistance increased substantially across much of Africa and WHO recommended dual\u2011AI nets (chlorfenapyr etc.) in 2023; randomized trials and WHO/Unitaid results show next\u2011generation (dual\u2011AI) nets reduce malaria vs pyrethroid\u2011only nets. Weaknesses: the author\u2019s quantitative attribution (the \u201c55% fewer cases\u201d counterfactual and the 34/27/39% Shapley\u2011style split) is a crude, ad\u2011hoc model with many simplifying assumptions and large uncertainty and therefore not well validated by external evidence. The PFAS / PermaNet 2.0 manufacturing\u2011change finding (PNG cone\u2011test results) is real, but its population\u2011level impact is uncertain (cone tests \u2260 field effectiveness). Overall: the descriptive claims are well supported; the precise quantitative apportionment is speculative.",
