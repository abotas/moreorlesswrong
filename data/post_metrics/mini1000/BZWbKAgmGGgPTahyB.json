    "explanation": "This is an operational/job-posting for a high-leverage outreach role at 80,000 Hours. For the EA community it is moderately important: 80k already drives a lot of recruitment and career choices, so a strong Engagement Specialist could materially increase outreach and the number of people pursuing high-impact careers, but the post itself is not a foundational argument or theory. For general humanity it is low importance \u2014 the effects are indirect and speculative: better hiring could scale EA influence some, but this single hiring decision is unlikely to be decisive for humanity's major outcomes."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Make the role's impact claims and success metrics clearer and more evidence\u2011based. The post lists very large, concrete outcomes (e.g. \u201ccost\u2011effectively deployed >$5m\u201d, \u201creached hundreds of millions\u201d, \u201chundreds of thousands of newsletter subscriptions\u201d) but doesn\u2019t give baselines, timeframes, or what metric you actually optimise for (CPEngagement? hours on site? conversions to newsletter? career changes?). This reads as aspirational and risks misleading applicants. Action: add the current baseline metrics (last 12 months reach, cost per engagement/subscriber, conversion rates), the primary KPIs this role will be held to, and label the bulleted \u201cwhat success might look like\u201d as aspirational targets or historical examples where appropriate. That will let candidates judge fit and seniority more accurately.  \n\n2) Reconcile scope, seniority, and experience expectations. The responsibilities include managing ~\u00a33m of outreach budget area, running cross\u2011channel strategy, analytics, creative execution, and partnership negotiation \u2014 but the post also says candidates without relevant experience should apply. That mismatch creates two risks: mis\u2011hiring someone underqualified for budget/strategy responsibility, or deterring strong candidates who expect a senior role. Action: state the expected seniority level (e.g. IC vs. manager), what decisions the Engagement Specialist can make autonomously (approve spend up to X, sign contracts up to Y), what support and mentorship will be provided, and whether this is meant as a training/entry role or a growth\u2011lead role. If you want a range of seniority, consider posting two role levels or explicitly describing a junior and senior hiring track.  \n\n3) Give clearer compensation and logistics to reduce applicant friction. The salary examples are helpful but not a clear band, and remote/visa support, trial compensation, and multi\u2011day in\u2011person trial logistics are vague. This may deter international or remote applicants and wastes time answering routine questions. Action: publish a salary band (min\u2013max) for UK and typical ranges for major remote locations or state that pay is location\u2011adjusted; explicitly state whether travel and trial days are paid and whether you reimburse travel/visa costs for the in\u2011person trial; clarify relocation/visa support scope and whether benefits are pro\u2011rated for remote hires. Small clarity here will increase applicant quality and reduce administrative back\u2011and\u2011forth.",
    "improvement_potential": "Targets three high\u2011leverage clarity problems that could produce real harms: misleading aspirational impact claims, a mismatch between budget/seniority and encouragement to apply without experience, and ambiguous pay/trial/visa logistics. Fixing these would materially improve candidate fit, reduce recruitment friction, and lower hiring risk, and the changes are straightforward and concise rather than requiring a long rewrite."

Minor weaknesses: a bit repetitive (salary repeated), some long bullets and links that could be trimmed or consolidated, and a few small ambiguities about remote/visa specifics.

    "explanation": "For EA Forum readers this is not very novel \u2014 it's a routine 80,000 Hours hiring/growth post and describes familiar strategies (sponsorships, ads, analytics, audience research) and the organisation's existing emphasis on AGI. The few mildly unusual elements are the large outreach budget for a nonprofit and explicit influencer/YouTube sponsorship scale, but those are already known within EA. For the general public it's slightly more novel than to EAs (nonprofit growth via high\u2011budget digital ads and major influencer sponsorships aimed at recruiting people into high\u2011impact careers is less common), but still a fairly standard job/marketing posting rather than an original idea."

    "reasoning_quality": 6,
    "evidence_quality": 5,

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post is logically organized and makes a coherent case for hiring (large existing audience, recent growth since 2022, a ~\u00a33M budget to deploy, concrete outreach channels and past sponsorships). It gives concrete, relevant examples (newsletter size, YouTube sponsorship partners, ad examples) and clear responsibilities that plausibly link the role to more reach. Weaknesses: Many of the headline impact claims are aspirational/speculative and rest on unstated assumptions (e.g. conversion rates from engagement to career change, marginal ROI of further spending). Key empirical details are missing or under-specified: what exactly drove the 6.5x increase, attribution and cost-effectiveness of past campaigns, baseline metrics (how 'hours engaged' are measured), and historical conversion rates from engagement to high\u2011impact career decisions. Overall, the post persuasively argues the role could be impactful but provides only moderate empirical support for the magnitude of the projected effects."

    "validation_notes": "Most of the post\u2019s key factual claims are supported by public material from 80,000 Hours and by the EA Survey, but several of the metrics are self-reported internal numbers that are not independently verifiable from public sources. Verified points: the job posting (location, salary ranges, application deadline, responsibilities, budget ~\u00a3/$3M, team composition) appears on 80,000 Hours\u2019 live job page. ([80000hours.org](https://80000hours.org/2025/04/open-position-engagement-specialist/)) The claim that 80,000 Hours is a leading source people cite for getting involved with EA is supported by the EA Survey 2022 analysis (80,000 Hours is the most frequently\u2011selected factor \u201cimportant for getting involved\u201d and a top source where people first heard of EA). ([forum.effectivealtruism.org](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/aTSoxTcSjyBWem3Xz/ea-survey-2022-how-people-get-involved-in-ea)) The organisation\u2019s stated newsletter size (>500,000 subscribers) and other audience metrics are repeatedly stated on 80,000 Hours\u2019 site (e.g. \u201cJoin over 500,000 newsletter subscribers\u201d and site summary metrics). These are credible as the organisation\u2019s current public claims but are self-reported. ([80000hours.org](https://80000hours.org/gettheguide/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) 80,000 Hours\u2019 recent strategic pivot toward AGI and the motivation for expanded growth investment are documented in their April 2025 strategic post. ([80000hours.org](https://80000hours.org/2025/04/strategic-approach/)) The job page also explicitly lists past partnerships/sponsorships with large YouTube channels and links to example videos (the video pages themselves are linked in the job post). These sponsorship claims are plausibly accurate given the provided links, but the traffic/engagement multipliers (e.g., \u201c6.5x increase in hours spent engaging since 2022\u201d, \u201creached millions of new users\u201d, or projected future outcomes) are internal analytics / projections reported by 80,000 Hours and are not independently verifiable from public sources. The organisation\u2019s UK charity registration is public (recent registration of the 80,000 Hours Foundation), but publicly-available UK Charity Commission filings do not yet provide detailed recent accounts to independently confirm the stated annual budget. ([register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/en/charity-search/-/charity-details/5241276/full-print?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [80000hours.org](https://80000hours.org/2025/04/open-position-engagement-specialist/)) Overall: factual administrative and descriptive claims (role, salary, deadline, team, sponsorship examples, EA Survey interpretation, newsletter size) are well-supported by primary sources; internal performance metrics and some budget details should be treated as credible self-reports but are not externally audited in public documents, hence a \u201c7 (Well\u2011supported)\u201d rating.",
