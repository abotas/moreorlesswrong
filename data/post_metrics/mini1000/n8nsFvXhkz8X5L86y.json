    "explanation": "This post is a useful, well-curated synthesis of many major catastrophic-risk lists and reports. For the EA/AI-safety/longtermist community it is moderately valuable: it consolidates cross-disciplinary sources, highlights consensus (nuclear, AI, pandemics, climate), points out policy uptake gaps, and can inform prioritization, outreach, and all\u2011hazards thinking\u2014but it is primarily summary rather than novel or argumentatively load\u2011bearing. For general humanity the post has limited direct impact: it raises awareness and aggregates expert views but is unlikely on its own to change large-scale policy or behavior."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Missing definitions, scope and prioritisation guidance \u2014 the post mixes societal crises, global catastrophic risks, and existential risks without clearly defining those categories or explaining why some lists are grouped together. Actionable fix: add a short opening paragraph that defines your terms (e.g., catastrophe vs global catastrophic risk vs existential risk) and a one\u2011sentence rule for why you included each source. If you want to keep the post short, replace some descriptive text with a compact taxonomy that maps each cited list onto those definitions so readers can immediately see scale/impact distinctions.\n\n2) Inadequate critical appraisal of methods and implied importance \u2014 many readers may assume inclusion on a list implies high probability or priority. You largely present sources uncritically (e.g., T\u00e4htinen\u2019s long inventory, UNDRR and WEF selections) without flagging methodological differences, expert selection biases, or lack of probability/impact weighting. Actionable fix: add 1\u20132 sentences under each major source summarising its key methodological strengths/weaknesses (sample size, expert selection, whether risks were weighted, whether causal chains/cascades were analysed). Consider one combined sentence explaining that lists are directional rather than probabilistic, so they should not be read as rankings of expected harm.\n\n3) Overgeneralised claims about policy uptake \u2014 the post argues policy makers neglect many risks but leans heavily on Boyd & Wilson (2020) and a small set of national reviews without acknowledging major counterexamples (IPCC influence on climate policy, WHO\u2019s role on pandemics, UN nuclear frameworks) or reasons why uptake varies (tractability, political salience, cost, attribution). Actionable fix: soften the claim (e.g., \u201cuneven uptake\u201d) and add 2\u20133 brief examples of where policy has engaged (and where it hasn\u2019t), plus a short sentence listing plausible explanations for variance (visibility, immediacy, tractability, vested interests). This will make the critique more credible and useful to readers seeking policy implications.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback correctly flags three important, non-trivial weaknesses: mixing scales (societal vs global catastrophic vs existential) without definitions, presenting lists uncritically (methods/weights/biases), and overstating policy neglect. Each point is actionable and can be fixed with brief additions (a concise taxonomy, 1\u20132 sentence method notes per major source, and a softened/nuanced paragraph on policy uptake), so the post would materially improve without bloating. It loses a couple of points because the suggestions are fairly high-level (could offer exact wording or a compact taxonomy example) and because the post\u2019s overall factual coverage is solid\u2014these issues are important but not fatal."

    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "Well structured and readable: clear purpose, logical headings, and helpful lists make the post easy to navigate and understand. Summaries of studies and the final takeaway are concise and informative. Weaknesses: occasionally informal language and asides (e.g. \"vibes\", first\u2011person notes) and some repetition dilute focus; selection criteria and audience could be stated more explicitly. Overall it functions well as a repository/survey but could be tightened in places for greater concision and rhetorical clarity."

    "explanation": "For EA Forum readers the post is mostly a well-organized synthesis of already-known sources (Ord, Avin, WEF, UNDRR, horizon scans etc.), so it adds modest value as curation but few genuinely new ideas or claims. For the general educated public it is moderately novel: the comprehensive compilation (including recent reports, the T\u00e4htinen taxonomy and Dal Pr\u00e1 horizon scan) and the policy-uptake discussion bring together material many non\u2011specialists will not have seen, but the underlying risks themselves are largely familiar."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post is well-structured and largely logical \u2014 it compiles and compares multiple reputable sources (T\u00e4htinen et al., UNDRR, WEF, Ord, Avin et al., Dal Pr\u00e1 et al., etc.), often noting methods and sample sizes, and it draws plausible, restrained conclusions (e.g., key shared risks are nuclear, AI, pandemics, climate). Weaknesses: The piece is mostly descriptive and relies on literature reviews, expert elicitations and surveys rather than primary empirical probability estimates; it gives little critical appraisal of the underlying methodologies, sampling biases, representativeness, or uncertainties in the cited studies; some comparative claims (e.g., which list is the \"most extensive\") are presented subjectively. Overall: a solid, well-sourced synthesis that would be stronger with more critical discussion of source limitations and more quantitative evidence where available."

    "validation_notes": "Mostly well\u2011supported. The post accurately summarizes and cites major, recent review papers and reports: T\u00e4htinen et al. (2024) (1714 sources, 54 experts \u2192 153 crises), the UNDRR \u2018Hazards with Escalation Potential\u2019 briefing (uses the UNDRR/ISC HIPs and identifies a ~10\u2011hazard subset with escalation potential), the WEF Global Risks Report 2025 (GRPS \u2248900 experts; state\u2011based armed conflict top immediate risk; misinformation and extreme weather emphasized), Avin et al. (2018) classification, Dal Pr\u00e1 et al. (2024) horizon scan (32 authors \u2192 96 items \u2192 15 prioritized), Boyd & Wilson (2020) UN Digital Library analysis (nuclear war \u224869% of explicit existential mentions), \u00d3 h\u00c9igeartaigh (2025) review, Sepasspour (2023) all\u2011hazards review, and Ord (2020). The post\u2019s characterization of those works and its high\u2011level syntheses are consistent with the sources. Minor caveats: a small number of interpretive/policy claims (e.g., the specific list of hazards included in some national risk assessments, or the statement that \u201cSwitzerland has the most thorough approach\u201d with an explicit list of hazards) are plausible but would need direct citation to each country\u2019s national risk documents to be fully verified; the UN HIPs count varies by edition (302 in the 2021 HIPs supplement; later updates reduced/changed counts to ~281\u2013282/282) and the post mixes references to HIP counts and the UNDRR escalation report (the basic claim that the UNDRR work drew on the HIPs is correct). Overall the post is well grounded in authoritative literature and reports; most major empirical claims can be verified from the cited documents.",
