    "actionable_feedback": "1) Missing value proposition and weak CTA \u2014 The post never says what a \u201cWrapped\u201d contains or why I should click. Add a one-sentence summary (e.g. \u201cA personalised summary of your 2024 Forum activity: top posts, comments, karma, topics you engaged with, and shareable highlights\u201d) and a prominent, clearly linked CTA button (\u201cOpen your EA Forum Wrapped\u201d) so readers know what they\u2019ll get and how to open it.\n\n2) Formatting and accessibility/UX bugs \u2014 There\u2019s a stray footnote marker / list item (\"1. **[^]\") that looks like a broken markdown/HTML render; fix or remove it. The hero image lacks alt text and may not scale on mobile; add a short descriptive alt attribute (e.g. \"Illustration: wrapped gift with EA Forum logo\") and ensure responsive sizing. Also make it clear whether the image or text is the clickable link.\n\n3) Missing privacy/share info \u2014 Users may reasonably want to know what data you used to generate the summary and whether they can opt out or share it. Add a one-line privacy note (e.g. \"This summary uses your public Forum activity \u2014 you can opt out or download your data here [link]\") and an obvious share/export option if you intend people to post their Wrapped publicly.",
    "improvement_potential": "Targets several high-impact, actionable issues: missing value proposition/CTA (hurts clicks), an obvious rendering/accessibility bug (looks unprofessional/embarrassing), and privacy/share clarity (legitimate user concern). Fixes are small, clear, and would materially improve UX and trust."

    "explanation": "I find no indication that 'Agnes Stenlund' is a known figure in the Effective Altruism/rationalist community or a publicly recognised author. No prominent publications, talks, or citations under that name are evident from available knowledge; the name may be a private individual or pseudonym. If you can share links or context (works, platforms), I can reassess."

    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The post is highly comprehensible and concise \u2014 a short, friendly announcement with a clear call to action and links to past years. Minor issues slightly reduce polish: a stray footnote marker and numbering, lack of an explicit link in the snippet, and no detail about what the 'Wrapped' contains, but overall it is easy to understand and follow."

    "explanation": "This is a routine 'Wrapped'/year-in-review feature (personal stats, links to prior years) which is common across online communities and platforms; EA readers will find it entirely unsurprising and the general public will have seen similar products (e.g. Spotify Wrapped), so there are no novel ideas or claims."

    "evidence_quality": 1,
    "overall_support": 2,
    "explanation": "This post is essentially an announcement/summary prompt rather than an argumentative piece: it makes no substantive claims that require logical argumentation, so there is little reasoning to assess. It provides a link to the wrapped page (appropriate for its purpose) but supplies no empirical evidence or data within the post itself. Strength: clear, concise call-to-action and link to prior years. Weakness: no supporting data or arguments presented, so it offers minimal substantive support for any broader claim beyond directing readers to view their wrap-up."

([forum.effectivealtruism.org](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Xem5o4iRHMSduNcPu/your-2024-ea-forum-wrapped)) The post lists multiple authors (Sarah Cheng, Agnes Stenlund, Ollie Etherington, Toby Tremlett), so attributing it solely to Agnes would be incomplete. ([forum.effectivealtruism.org](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Xem5o4iRHMSduNcPu/your-2024-ea-forum-wrapped)) The site also provides prior-year Wrapped pages for 2023 and 2022. ([forum.effectivealtruism.org](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/eHKhrvBexNtj6ahj2/your-ea-forum-2023-wrapped?utm_source=openai)) The personalized Wrapped pages require logging in to view details, so the specific per-user stats cannot be confirmed without account access. ([forum.effectivealtruism.org](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/wrapped/2023)) A minor on-page note about an iPhone 13 animation bug is included in comments; that is stated in the post thread but is a self-reported operational note rather than an independently validated system-wide fact.
