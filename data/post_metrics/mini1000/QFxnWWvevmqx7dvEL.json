    "explanation": "This is a useful, pragmatic announcement about an RCT of a procrastination-coaching programme. If the trial shows strong effects and the programme is rolled out to EAs, it could meaningfully improve individual productivity and wellbeing for some people, which has modest downstream impact on EA effectiveness. However, the claim is neither foundational nor high-stakes for core EA priorities (e.g., AI safety, global health) and the scale is limited; for general humanity it\u2019s of only minor relevance given many existing behaviour-change interventions."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Missing/unclear primary outcomes, power, and pre-registration \u2014 fix before publishing. The post doesn\u2019t say what the RCT\u2019s primary and secondary outcomes are (objective productivity vs self-report, follow-up timing), the target sample size or power calculation, how you\u2019ll handle missing data/attrition, or whether the trial is pre-registered. Actionable fix: state the primary outcome(s), planned measurement schedule, target N with a brief power calculation or minimum detectable effect, the analysis plan (intention-to-treat, handling of missing data), and include a link to the pre-registered protocol or promise to pre-register before randomisation. This is the single biggest methodological gap readers will worry about.  \n\n2) High risk of selection and measurement bias \u2014 address and mitigate. Recruiting a mixed sample (EAs, animal advocates, general population), using a waitlist control, offering small monetary compensation, limited coach hours (time-zone constraints), and relying on self-report pilot feedback all create strong selection and attrition biases and threaten generalisability. Actionable fix: describe recruitment quotas or stratified randomisation (e.g., stratify by group/timezone/prior experience), plan objective outcomes if possible (time-tracking, work output proxies) or validated scales, and explain retention strategies and incentive rationale (why \u00a310 is enough and how you\u2019ll limit differential attrition). Also clarify exact exclusion criteria (what counts as a \u201csevere mental health condition\u201d) and how screening is administered.  \n\n3) Overclaims from pilot and social proof \u2014 be more transparent and modest. The post leans on qualitative pilot quotes and small-scale social proof (Trustpilot n=34, testimonials) to justify expectations, but gives no pilot sample size, effect estimates, or how representative that sample was. Actionable fix: add concrete pilot numbers (n, baseline scores, effect sizes, follow-up duration, attrition), caveats about generalisability, and avoid implying efficacy until the RCT is pre-registered and analysed. If you want recruitment, consider adding a short link to the trial protocol and an explicit statement about what you will and will not claim based on RCT results.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback identifies major, substantive omissions that materially affect how credible the RCT will look to an evidence-focused readership \u2014 missing primary outcomes, sample size/power, analysis plan, and pre-registration are core RCT details readers expect; selection/measurement bias and over-reliance on small-scale qualitative pilot data are also important and potentially embarrassing to be called out on. The suggested fixes are actionable and directly improve transparency and credibility without requiring unnecessary length in the post (just a few key additions/links)."

Minor issues reduce perfect clarity: small inconsistencies (payment phrasing, testimonial referencing six sessions vs four), slightly ambiguous phrasing around randomisation timing and the \u201c~20% failure rate,\u201d and some long verbatim quotes that add length without clarifying core points."

    "explanation": "Most content is routine: a short CBT/mindfulness-based coaching programme, a waitlist-controlled RCT, small participant compensation, and pilot feedback \u2014 all familiar to EA readers and behaviour-change practitioners. The only mildly uncommon elements are the explicit targeting of EAs/animal advocates, the promise to roll out the programme free to those groups if the RCT is strong, and some operational details (coach recruitment scale, explicit ~20% failure rate). These do not represent substantially new conceptual ideas."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The intervention is grounded in plausibly effective methods (CBT, mindfulness, habit coaching), the organisers acknowledge limitations, and planning an RCT is the right next step. Weaknesses: Claims rely mainly on unreported pilot data and testimonials (no sample size, effect sizes, validated outcomes, or control), substantial risk of selection and reporting bias, short-term/self\u2011report measures likely, and social proof is limited/susceptible to conflicts of interest. Overall the argument is logically plausible but empirically weak until the RCT produces transparent, quantitative results."

    "validation_notes": "Major structural claims are well-supported: Overcome is a real EA-aligned mental-health charity (John Salter founder) and has publicly posted recruitment/offer posts on the EA Forum; the waitlist-controlled RCT of a 4-week, 4\u00d760-min lay\u2011coach CBT/MI intervention is registered/listed in trial registries (NCT06814197 / related listings) and shows planned enrollment (~100\u2013117) and trial design consistent with the post. Hive/AIM partnerships and promotional activity are corroborated by Hive and EA Forum posts. Trustpilot shows a high average rating for Overcome (the exact n and score have changed over time). Major weaknesses: the pilot outcome figures (the 15%/65%/15%/5% feedback breakdown), the \u201c~20% failure\u201d number, coach-batch counts (19th batch) and applicant counts (~80 \u2192 ~400) are reported only by Overcome/John Salter in forum posts and are not accompanied by publicly available pilot datasets, pre-registered analyses, or peer\u2011reviewed results \u2014 i.e., these performance metrics are self-reported and not independently verifiable. The trial registry entry also states individual participant data will not be shared (limits external verification). Conclusion: core organizational and trial claims are validated; effect-size / pilot-performance claims lack independent public data so should be treated as provisional/self-reported.",
