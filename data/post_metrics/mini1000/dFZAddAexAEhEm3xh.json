    "explanation": "This is a practical, user-interface/community-curation question about getting a more cause-balanced EA Forum feed. It's useful for individual EA members who want broader exposure and could modestly affect attention allocation in the community, but it's not foundational to EA theory, strategy, or global outcomes\u2014its consequences are fairly localized and low-stakes for humanity at large."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Be much more specific about the goal and current state. Say exactly what you mean by \u2018\u2018cause balanced\u2019\u2019 (e.g. equal number of posts per cause on the front page over a week, equal share of karma-weighted slots, or something else), how many slots the front page shows, and what fraction of current slots are AI posts. List the exact settings you\u2019ve already tried (you mention a 50% karma reduction) and include a short screenshot or numbers showing the current distribution. This will make answers targeted and avoid people suggesting obvious, irrelevant tweaks.\n\n2) Don\u2019t present \u2018\u2018reduce AI karma by 50%\u2019\u2019 as the only option without exploring common alternatives. Call out that you haven\u2019t considered (or say whether you tried) these options and ask about them explicitly: tuning topic/tag filters, muting or hiding tags/authors, following specific tags or lists, using saved searches or multiple custom feeds, using the RSS feed + an external filter (Inoreader/IFTTT), or asking EAF maintainers for a front-page weighting feature. If you want people to propose technical fixes, request suggestions about which of these approaches are supported or practical on EAF.\n\n3) Acknowledge and ask about important trade-offs up front. Balancing the front page will likely change the signal-to-noise trade-off (you\u2019ll see less popular/less-engaged posts), and it may reduce the usefulness of karma as a quality signal. Say whether you\u2019re willing to accept these costs or if you want a compromise (e.g. keep posts above a minimum karma but equalize causes). That will prevent answers that solve balance at the expense of quality or engagement you weren\u2019t prepared to accept.",
    "improvement_potential": "Addresses key omissions in the post: lack of precise goal/metrics, missing mention of common alternatives, and absent discussion of trade-offs. These are practical, high-impact fixes that will make answers targeted and avoid obvious wasted suggestions; they\u2019re concise and won\u2019t overly lengthen the post."

    "explanation": "The post is clear, concise, and makes a specific request: how to get a more \"cause balanced\" EAF front page and whether reducing karma on AI posts is the only option. It uses simple language and includes a screenshot. It could be improved by defining \"cause balanced\" more precisely, clarifying what \"reduce karma by 50% on AI posts\" means (which setting/tool), and giving the target balance or timeframe sought."

    "explanation": "This is a practical, product/UX question about reweighting a forum feed to be 'cause balanced' rather than a novel conceptual idea. EA Forum readers have likely encountered and discussed feed weighting, tag filters, and karma adjustments before, so it's not very original for that audience. For the general public it's slightly more novel because the specific goal of balancing moral 'cause areas' on a niche platform is less common, though the underlying idea (tuning feeds to reduce topic dominance) is familiar from other social platforms."

    "explanation": "The post is mainly a request for help rather than an argument: it offers an ad-hoc tactic (halving karma on AI posts) but provides no structured reasoning about why that should reliably produce a cause-balanced feed or about trade-offs. There is virtually no empirical evidence \u2014 only an illustrative screenshot and the author's current setup \u2014 and no systematic testing, metrics, or broader data. As a result the claim (that altering karma settings can achieve balance) is weakly supported; the post is appropriate as a question but provides little rigorous support or evidence."

The EA Forum provides per-topic weighting controls (default +25 for subscribe; \u201creduce\u201d is described as equivalent to \u221250%/\u221250% karma and there is an \u201cOther\u201d field for custom numeric adjustments). These features verify the OP\u2019s statement that they can reduce AI-topic karma by ~50% and that they can set other values. The Forum does not provide a built\u2011in \u201cequalize across causes\u201d or guaranteed variety view \u2014 you can approximate balance by manually tuning per-topic weights, using topic tabs, or RSS filters, but there is no native feature that enforces an equal number of posts per cause. Strength: claims about available controls and limits are confirmed by official Forum documentation and related Forum posts. Weakness: the post implies (correctly) that per-topic tuning is somewhat ad\u2011hoc \u2014 that is a subjective judgement but matches Forum guidance.",
