    "explanation": "This is a useful, pragmatic point about improving clarity and accessibility in EA conversations. If taken seriously it would modestly reduce confusion, improve persuasion to non\u2011philosophers, and lower category\u2011mistakes (e.g. conflating 'caring about consequences' with the technical doctrine of consequentialism). However it is not load\u2011bearing for core EA claims or major decisions (it changes rhetoric and culture more than fundamentals), so its importance to the EA community is moderate. For general humanity the effect is negligible beyond slightly clearer public communication."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Fix the mistaken claim that consequentialism and deontology are strictly incompatible.  This is an important factual error because readers who know the literature will stop trusting the rest of the piece.  There are many hybrid or middle-ground views (rule-consequentialism, threshold deontology, two-level approaches, moral pluralism, etc.) and the more accurate claim is that they\u2019re often in tension, not always logically impossible to combine.  Action: soften the language (e.g. \u201coften in tension\u201d not \u201cincompatible\u201d), remove absolutist examples like \u201c80% utilitarian / 20% deontologist\u201d as a categorical error, and add one short parenthetical example of a hybrid view so readers see you\u2019ve checked the literature.  \n\n2) Add a short, practical guideline for when to use vs. avoid technical terms (and give a simple template).  The post\u2019s main useful point is about clarity and audience, but it currently reads like a blanket prescription.  Action: replace \u201cwe should rarely\u2026\u201d with conditional guidance (e.g. avoid technical labels in public/introductory/practical posts; use them in theory-heavy debates or when you need precision).  Give a 1\u20132 sentence template readers can copy: \u201cSay in plain language first, then optionally add the technical label in parentheses and a one-line definition.\u201d  Provide 1\u20132 concrete before/after examples from EA-style discussions (e.g. fundraising tradeoffs, norm enforcement) so readers can immediately apply the rule.  \n\n3) Acknowledge and rebut the main counterargument you currently overlook: technical terms often prevent equivocation and increase precision.  Critics will point out that removing the lingo can hide substantive disagreements or normative assumptions.  Action: add a short paragraph conceding that technical terms have legitimate uses (precision, signaling, linking to literature), explain how your approach preserves precision (plain claim + parenthetical label/definition), and give one quick example where the technical term actually avoids confusion.  This both strengthens credibility and reduces the chance of the post being dismissed as naive.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback pins down a significant factual error (treating consequentialism and deontology as strictly incompatible) that undermines the author's credibility, and gives practical, concise fixes (soften absolutes, add hybrid example, offer conditional guidance and templates, and concede the precision benefit of technical terms). Implementing these would materially improve accuracy and usefulness without bloating the post."

    "explanation": "Overall the post is clear, well-structured and easy to follow. Strengths: short summary up front, three numbered failure-modes with concrete examples, and practical wording-replacements make the point tangible and actionable. Weaknesses: a few philosophical claims are stated without support (e.g. the strict incompatibility framing), and some sentences are slightly repetitive; minor formatting/footnote oddities and a few strong generalizations could be softened or qualified. But for an EA audience it communicates its message effectively and concisely."

    "explanation": "The main claim \u2014 favour plain language over philosophical jargon in practical EA conversations, and avoid conflating 'consequences' with commitment to consequentialist metaethics or treating rules as equivalent to deontology \u2014 is clear but not new. EA readers and forum regulars have frequently discussed jargon, accessibility, and misuse of 'consequentialism'/'deontology', so the piece is low on novelty for that audience. For the general public the recommendation is slightly more novel in an EA-specific context, but the underlying idea (avoid technical terms when plain words suffice) is common and widely advocated, so still only modestly novel."

    "overall_support": 4,
    "explanation": "Strengths: The post presents a clear, coherent pragmatic argument\u2014technical moral-philosophy labels can obstruct clarity in everyday EA discussion, conflations (e.g. 'rules = deontology', 'consequences = consequentialism') are plausibly common, and simple language like 'impact' or 'norms' often suffices. The author gives concrete examples of how terminology can muddle discussion and offers easy-to-adopt alternatives. \n\nWeaknesses: The piece is largely rhetorical and anecdotal and provides no empirical evidence (e.g. reader comprehension tests, examples from EA threads, or citations). It glosses over philosophical subtleties (for instance, many practitioners use hybrid frameworks or explicit two\u2011level views; saying consequentialism and deontology are wholly incompatible is an oversimplification). It also underplays contexts where technical terms are useful (precision, disambiguation, signaling shared background, or theoretical debate). Overall, the argument is plausible and pragmatically useful in many contexts, but under-supported by data and somewhat simplified philosophically, so the recommendation should be treated as a sensible heuristic rather than a definitive rule."

    "validation_notes": "Most empirical claims in the post are well supported: (a) EA discussion frequently uses terms like 'consequentialism' and 'deontology' (many EA Forum posts and tags discuss these topics), and EA community surveys show a strong consequentialist tilt (\u224880% in the EA Survey). (b) There is independent evidence from communication research and plain-language policy that jargon reduces readability/accessibility and that replacing technical terms with everyday language often improves comprehension. However the post\u2019s stronger philosophical claim \u2014 that consequentialism and deontology are strictly incompatible and \u201ccan\u2019t be combined without losing what\u2019s central to each\u201d \u2014 is overstated: major philosophical literature documents hybrid/compromise views (rule\u2011consequentialism, threshold deontology, pluralist or hybrid consequentialist theories). Overall: most empirical descriptive claims are supported, the normative recommendation (avoid jargon) is plausibly supported by evidence on readability, but a key theoretical claim about incompatibility is inaccurate or at least contested in the literature.",
