    "explanation": "This is a high-quality, practically useful meta-level piece for the EA community: it clearly frames three distinct kinds of prioritization (cause-level, within-cause, cross-cause), supplies empirical estimates showing a strong tilt toward within-cause work (\u224889% vs \u224810% CP/CCP), and lays out the strengths, failure modes, and actionable next steps (VOI, variance, tractability analyses). If its diagnosis and recommendations are taken seriously, EA funders and research orgs could rebalance effort in ways that materially affect where money and talent flow \u2014 so it is load-bearing for strategic choices within EA. For general humanity its direct importance is limited: it\u2019s an internal methodology/agenda-setting piece whose downstream effects on human welfare depend on whether EA implements the suggested changes, so it has minor rather than foundational impact."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) The central empirical claim (\"~89% within-cause, 2% cross-cause, 9% cause prioritization\") is fragile and risks misleading readers. The FTE accounting is based on a small, non\u2011representative set of organisations, uses rough classifications, ignores informal/individual prioritization and donor-level decision-making, and doesn\u2019t report uncertainty or sensitivity. Actionable fix: either substantially strengthen this section (expand the sample, publish classification rules, add uncertainty bounds/sensitivity analyses and alternative aggregations such as $ spent, grant decisions, and informal community effort) or substantially tone down the claim and reframe it as a provisional illustrative snapshot.  \n\n2) The post makes a strong normative claim (EA may be \"radically misallocating\" prioritization effort) without a marginal/VOI argument showing why shifting researcher FTEs would plausibly increase impact. Actionable fix: include at least one concrete, quantitative toy analysis or scenario (VOI-style) that shows when and how reallocating effort from WCP to CP/CCP yields positive expected value, or explicitly label the recommendation as speculative and propose a concrete research agenda to estimate marginal returns before recommending reallocation.  \n\n3) The taxonomy treats CP, WCP and CCP as neat, mutually exclusive buckets and underplays hybrid work, transaction costs, and incentive constraints. In practice many projects are hybrid (e.g., cause\u2011level theory + intervention pilots), and switching emphasis has real costs (reputation, hiring, institutional lock\u2011in, donor preferences). Actionable fix: clarify the taxonomy (allow overlapping/hybrid categories), give examples of mixed activities, and add a short section on the practical costs and institutional incentives that make reallocation nontrivial\u2014this will make recommendations more realistic and actionable for org leaders and donors.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback catches major, credibility\u2011undermining problems. The FTE breakdown is the post\u2019s central empirical evidence and is indeed fragile (small, nonrepresentative sample; rough classifications; no uncertainty), so the first point is a crucial own\u2011goal to fix. The second point rightly demands a marginal/VOI argument before implying resource reallocation \u2014 without it the normative claim is speculative. The third point about treating CP/WCP/CCP as cleanly separate when many efforts are hybrid and reallocation has real transaction costs is also important for realism and actionability. The suggested fixes are concrete and feasible, and implementing them would substantially improve the post\u2019s persuasiveness without requiring an overhaul."

    "explanation": "I could not identify a clearly prominent EA/rationalist author named 'Bob Fischer'.

If you can share links or more context, I can reassess."

    "post_id": "ZPdZv8sHuYndD8xhJ",
    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "Overall the post is well organized and easy to follow: it defines terms up front (CP/WCP/CCP), gives a concise executive summary, uses examples and a summary table, and walks the reader through strengths, pitfalls, cruxes, and concrete next steps. Those features make the central argument (that EA currently overweight WCP and should rebalance effort across the three types) clear and compelling. Weaknesses: the piece is long and somewhat repetitive (the appendix restates many points), the heavy FTE accounting and footnoted assumptions are dense and would benefit from clearer caveats, and occasional jargon/visual references may not render for all readers. A tighter distillation of core recommendations and clearer labeling of uncertain estimates would improve conciseness and transparency."

    "novelty_humanity": 7,
    "explanation": "For EA readers the core concepts (cause vs intervention comparisons, ITN-style thinking, hedging across causes, difficulties of commensurability) are well-trodden, so the post is only modestly novel. Its main new contributions for that audience are the explicit three-way taxonomy (CP/WCP/CCP), the crude FTE accounting across major EA orgs, and the concrete list of \u2018cruxes\u2019 and research next steps \u2014 useful framing but not groundbreaking. For a general educated audience the material is substantially more original: the structured taxonomy of prioritization types, tradeoffs, and the argument that most effort is concentrated within-cause (with implications) are likely new and informative to people outside EA."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post gives a clear, well\u2011structured taxonomy (cause / within\u2011cause / cross\u2011cause), enumerates plausible strengths/weaknesses of each approach, lists important cruxes, and transparently proposes next steps. The argumentation is balanced and self\u2011critical in places. Weaknesses: the key empirical claim (that EA prioritization effort is heavily skewed toward within\u2011cause work and that this likely produces a substantial misallocation) rests largely on rough, subjective FTE classifications for a non\u2011exhaustive set of organisations and excludes informal, donor, and individual effort. The piece offers little direct empirical evidence that shifting effort to cause or cross\u2011cause work would raise impact (no VOI analyses, counterfactuals, or outcome comparisons). In short, the reasoning is coherent and useful for framing the problem, but the empirical foundation is limited, so the central conjecture remains plausible but insufficiently demonstrated."

    "validation_notes": "The post\u2019s qualitative claims and framing (the three prioritization types; their strengths/weaknesses; that EA\u2019s work tends to emphasise within\u2011cause, and that cross\u2011cause work is relatively rare) are well supported by public materials and by the authors\u2019 own documented estimates. Several concrete factual claims are verifiable (e.g., GiveWell directed \u2248$439M in 2022; Open Philanthropy\u2019s rapid growth to ~>110\u2013150 staff and \u2248$750M+ annual grantmaking in recent years; 80,000 Hours\u2019 strategic shift toward AI in 2025). However, the central quantitative breakdown (the 89% within\u2011cause / 8.8% cause / 1.8% cross\u2011cause split) depends on the authors\u2019 FTE allocations and a linked internal spreadsheet of rough judgements. Those FTE estimates are explicitly labelled \u201crough\u201d by the authors and are not independently verifiable from public sources; different reasonable assumptions would materially change the percentages. In short: the qualitative diagnosis is well supported (score near \u2018well\u2011supported\u2019), but the precise numeric split should be treated as an informed, but not strongly externally validated, estimate.",
