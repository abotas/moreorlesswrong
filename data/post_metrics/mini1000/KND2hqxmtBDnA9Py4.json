    "explanation": "This post is a useful framing/communication piece for the EA/AI\u2011safety community: it clarifies a non\u2011anthropomorphic way to think about LLM risks (probabilistic generation of undesirable sequences), encourages precision about which parts of the risk come from current architectures versus future algorithmic advances, and offers a concrete mathematical lens that can help when talking to skeptics. It\u2019s not a technical breakthrough or foundational proof about existential risk, so it\u2019s moderately important (useful for persuasion, modeling choices, and research framing) rather than critical. For general humanity the impact is limited \u2014 it may slightly improve public understanding or debates about AI by removing scare\u2011y imagery, but it\u2019s not likely to change large-scale policy or outcomes on its own."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Over\u2011claim that sequence probabilities are \u201ctrivial\u201d to calculate \u2014 but you don\u2019t treat the decoding/sampling and context dependencies that make the statement misleading. For an autoregressive model you can compute token probabilities given a fixed context and decoding rule, but (a) different decoding algorithms (temperature, top-k/top-p, beam search) induce different effective generation distributions, (b) many deployed models incorporate dynamic context, retrieval, system prompts or stateful multi\u2011turn histories, and (c) computing exact probabilities over very long sequences or across many conditional contexts is computationally nontrivial. Actionable fix: qualify the claim (e.g., \u201cfor a fixed model, fixed prompt/context and fixed decoding rule, the model defines a probability distribution over token sequences and token probabilities can be computed\u201d), and add one short sentence noting how decoding choice and dynamic context change the relevant distribution in practice. \n\n2) Skips how hopeless (and practically different) summing/integrating over \u201cundesirable\u201d sequences really is, and ignores adversarial/interactive inputs. You note we can\u2019t currently do the integral but don\u2019t explain why it\u2019s not just a scalability problem \u2014 it\u2019s combinatorially intractable, depends on the (ill\u2011specified) set of undesirable sequences, and is made far worse when users can craft prompts or interactively steer the model. Actionable fix: add one paragraph that (a) explains the intractability concisely (huge token space + context distribution), (b) points out that deployment/user input/distributional shift and adversarial prompting make a priori bounds nearly useless unless you model those inputs, and (c) briefly mention practical alternatives (Monte Carlo estimation, classifier\u2011based detection, adversarial red\u2011teaming, worst\u2011case analyses) so readers see how this abstract math connects to real safety work.\n\n3) Conflates bounding raw output probability with addressing most safety concerns. Even if you could bound the probability of particular bad sequences, that doesn\u2019t capture many major risk pathways (goal-directed behavior, capability growth, chaining of outputs into real\u2011world actions, automation of harmful misuse). Skeptics focused on consciousness/agency will accept that content probabilities matter but will still raise other plausible risk channels. Actionable fix: add a short caveat near the top or bottom explicitly saying this framing targets content\u2011generation risks (undesired sequences) and doesn\u2019t by itself address agency, misuse, or long\u2011term capability escalation \u2014 and invite discussion about how the probabilistic framing complements (rather than replaces) those other concerns.\n\nThese three fixes will remove the biggest potential reader objections and make the post much more accurate while keeping it short.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback identifies real, non-trivial technical mistakes and important missing caveats (overstating 'trivial' probability calculation, understating combinatorial/intractability and adversarial/contextual issues, and conflating sequence-probability bounds with broader risk pathways). Fixing these points would substantially improve accuracy and reduce obvious reader objections without adding much length \u2014 they are critical clarifications but not arguments that overturn the post's overall point, so an 8 is appropriate."

    "explanation": "The post is generally clear, concise, and accessible \u2014 it communicates a concrete, non-anthropomorphic framing (probabilistic bounds on undesirable sequences) and explains why that framing may be useful when talking to skeptics. Strengths: simple language, focused purpose, and a concrete mathematical viewpoint. Weaknesses: it refers vaguely to \u201cthis post\u201d without summarizing it fully or linking it inline, uses a bit of technical shorthand (e.g. 'LLM (without random seed)') that could confuse nontechnical readers, and could more explicitly state the practical implications of the probabilistic framing."

    "explanation": "For an EA Forum / AI\u2011safety audience these points are familiar: treating LLMs as probability machines, framing alignment as distributional/control problem, and noting we can compute sequence probabilities but not easily aggregate over 'undesirable' sets are standard technical framings. The post\u2019s most original-ish move is the explicit emphasis on bounding integrated probabilities over undesirable sequences as the core mathematical problem, and using the non\u2011anthropomorphic framing as a communication tool \u2014 useful but not novel to specialists. For the general public, the probabilistic, non\u2011anthropomorphic framing and the concrete explanation of what \u2018alignment\u2019 could mean (bounding output probabilities) are reasonably new and clarifying, so the idea is moderately novel to that audience."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post gives a clear, logically coherent and non\u2011anthropomorphic framing of LLM risk \u2014 treating risks as probabilities of generating undesirable token sequences \u2014 and correctly notes that per\u2011sequence probabilities are computable while summing/integrating over the enormous sequence space is intractable. This is a useful conceptual reframing that can help clarify some debates with skeptics. Weaknesses: The argument is incomplete and somewhat oversimplified. It treats alignment as primarily a mathematical counting/integration problem and underweights other key issues (interactive/multi\u2011turn behavior, RL fine\u2011tuning and goal formation, system integration and feedback loops, distributional shift, specification ambiguity, adversarial prompting, and practical detectability). The post provides little empirical evidence or concrete demonstrations \u2014 mostly conceptual and mathematical claims \u2014 and does not engage with empirical counterexamples or alternative safety approaches. Overall the thesis is plausible and clarifying but not strongly supported as a complete account of LLM safety risks."

    "validation_notes": "Major empirical claims in the post are well-supported. It is correct that an autoregressive LLM assigns a (joint) probability to any given token sequence via the chain rule, and that tooling/API support exists to compute token-level log-probs (so computing a sequence probability from those logprobs is straightforward). ([stanford-cs324.github.io](https://stanford-cs324.github.io/winter2022/lectures/introduction/?utm_source=openai), [cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/using_logprobs?utm_source=openai), [discuss.huggingface.co](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/announcement-generation-get-probabilities-for-generated-output/30075?utm_source=openai)) However, the post is also correct that summing or integrating that probability mass over the (very large) set of all \u201cundesirable\u201d sequences to produce exact, tight frequency bounds is computationally infeasible in practice: the space of possible sequences grows exponentially with length, and exact weighted model-counting is #P-hard in general.

([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07858?utm_source=openai), [openai.com](https://openai.com/index/advancing-red-teaming-with-people-and-ai/?utm_source=openai)) Caveats: saying \u201ctrivial to calculate\u201d is true mathematically and often practical via APIs, but in real deployments you must consider tokenization, decoding strategy (temperature/top\u2011p/top\u2011k), numeric underflow/log-space handling, and API limits on returned top_logprobs, which can complicate exact end\u2011to\u2011end accounting.
