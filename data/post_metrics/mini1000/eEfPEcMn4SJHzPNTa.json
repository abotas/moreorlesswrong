    "explanation": "The post highlights an important, underappreciated failure mode for alignment: training on observed human behavior risks institutionalizing our value\u2013action gaps. For the EA/AI-safety community this is fairly load-bearing because it bears on value-selection, dataset choices, and whether we aim to mirror or improve human norms (hence a ~7). For general humanity it matters materially \u2014 biased, shortsighted systems could be amplified at scale \u2014 but the post is agenda-setting and high-level rather than novel or technically prescriptive, so its direct immediate impact is somewhat lower (~6)."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Big missing discussion on \u2018whose\u2019 and \u2018what\u2019 values to select (value pluralism and power). The post assumes there is a single, discoverable set of \u201caspirational\u201d human values to align AI toward. That\u2019s a huge normative leap. Actionable fixes: briefly acknowledge deep disagreement across cultures, classes, and stakeholders; add one or two concrete mechanisms for selecting values (e.g. deliberative democratic processes, multi-stakeholder value-aggregation, or clear normative criteria and trade-offs); and flag the political risks of leaving selection vague. Cite or link to work on preference aggregation, normative pluralism, or social choice as concrete next steps.\\n\\n2) Understates ethical/political costs of using AI as \u2018moral scaffolding\u2019. The post presents nudging humans toward better behavior as an unalloyed good, but doesn\u2019t confront autonomy, paternalism, manipulation, and legitimacy concerns. Actionable fixes: add a short section on potential harms and necessary safeguards (consent, transparency, opt-out, auditability, pluralistic governance), and give examples of where well-intentioned behaviour-change tech caused backlash or harms. This prevents the post from reading as naive techno-optimism.\\n\\n3) Technical simplifications about how models learn and about mitigations. Several claims (e.g. behavioral imitation = lock-in; RLHF/Constitutional AI \u2018approximate\u2019 aspirational alignment) are plausible but under-evidenced and overgeneralized. Actionable fixes: temper strong claims, add concrete mitigation proposals (curated aspirational datasets, explicit preference learning and calibration, counterfactual/auditable training pipelines, adversarial audits for moral trade-offs), and point readers to relevant technical literature or experiments. If space is limited, convert a couple of the stronger speculative claims into explicit open questions rather than facts.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback pinpoints three central, substantive omissions: (1) the huge normative question of whose values to pick (value pluralism and power), (2) the ethical/political risks of using AI to nudge human behaviour (paternalism, autonomy, legitimacy), and (3) overgeneralised technical claims that should be tempered and paired with concrete mitigations. These are critical to the post's credibility and would embarrass the author if left unaddressed, yet the suggested fixes are actionable and need not greatly lengthen the piece. Addressing them would materially improve the post without overturning its core insight."

    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "Well-structured and easy to follow: strong TL;DR, clear headings, helpful tables and concrete examples that make the central claim (value\u2013action gap risks being codified in AI) intuitive and compelling. Weaknesses: occasional jargon and high-level labels (e.g., \u201cValue Selection,\u201d \u201cMoral Alignment\u201d) are underdefined, some claims lean on broad examples without nuanced caveats, and a few passages repeat the same point \u2014 tightening definitions and adding brief operational detail would make it even clearer."

    "explanation": "Most components (the value\u2013action / attitude\u2013behaviour gap, cognitive mechanisms like present bias and moral licensing, risks of training on behavioural data, feedback\u2011loop amplification) are well known in psychology and AI ethics and are already discussed in EA/longtermist circles. What is modestly novel is the particular framing: calling the human dispositions a psychological \u201cprogram\u201d to be avoided, stressing human\u2011alignment (changing humans\u2019 behaviour/values) as a necessary precursor to AI alignment, and the explicit pitch to treat AI as \u2018moral scaffolding.\u2019 For EA readers this synthesis/reframing is moderately familiar (hence mid score). For the general educated public, the specific linkage between the value\u2013action gap and large\u2011scale AI training plus the programmatic tri\u2011level solution will feel newer (higher score)."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post presents a clear, coherent argument chain (value\u2013action gap \u2192 risk of behavioral imitation by AI \u2192 need for explicit value selection and human alignment). It draws on well-established psychological mechanisms (present bias, moral licensing, cognitive dissonance) with references, and gives plausible illustrative failure modes. Weaknesses: Several leaps are asserted rather than demonstrated \u2014 notably the claim that training on behavioural data will necessarily codify and amplify the gap at scale \u2014 and counterarguments (preference learning, normative supervision, regulatory/engineering mitigations, pluralism of values) are not engaged. Empirical support is mixed: some psychological findings are cited, but many table statistics lack direct sourcing in-text, and there is little to no direct empirical evidence showing that real-world AI systems have concretely amplified the value\u2013action gap. Overall, the thesis is plausible and well-motivated but under-supported by direct empirical linkage and detailed mitigation plans."

    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 7,
    "validation_notes": "The post\u2019s central empirical claim \u2014 that there is a persistent value\u2013action gap across domains and that psychological mechanisms (present bias, cognitive dissonance, moral licensing, self-enhancement) help explain it \u2014 is well supported by published research and large-scale field data. Representative evidence: (a) high stated willingness-to-pay or preference for sustainable/ethical products (Nielsen, YouGov, PwC) contrasted with much weaker revealed-purchase behaviour (multiple consumer studies/reviews); (b) a large global field experiment on civic honesty (17,000 \u2018lost wallets\u2019) showing return rates around ~40\u201372% depending on conditions; (c) strong audit evidence of hiring discrimination (Bertrand & Mullainathan 2004); and (d) meta-analytic and theoretical literature documenting moral licensing, cognitive dissonance, present-bias and self-enhancement. Several of the post\u2019s numeric summaries are reasonable approximations but compress nuance and depend on survey wording, populations, and definitions: for example, \u201c60\u201370% claim to prefer eco-friendly brands\u201d is consistent with multiple willingness-to-pay surveys (Nielsen et al.), but the specific figure \u201c~25% actually buy when it costs \u226510% more\u201d is harder to verify as a single global statistic (revealed-behaviour conversion rates vary a lot by product, market, and price premium). The claim \u201c99% of meat sold in the US comes from industrial farms\u201d is slightly imprecise but captures the empirically supported fact that ~98\u201399% of US farmed animals are raised in concentrated/industrial operations (see Sentience Institute / Our World in Data analyses). The HR / equal-opportunity >90% endorsement is plausible for self-reports of endorsement but varies by sample and question wording; the post\u2019s overall pattern (large stated support, weaker behavioural/structural follow-through) is well supported. Overall: the post is empirically well grounded in mainstream literature, but several headline percentages should be presented with caveats about definitions, survey frames, and cross-country variability.",
