    "explanation": "This is a narrow, practical donor question about cost-per-disability-averted for a specific charity/intervention. It can matter for individual giving choices and might prompt useful cost-effectiveness discussion (DALYs, incidence of disability from malaria, AMF costing), but it is not a foundational theoretical claim and won\u2019t substantially shift major EA or policy conclusions on its own. Its practical impact is limited to helping donors compare interventions rather than changing worldview or large-scale priorities."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Unsupported, oversimplified headline number \u2014 replace the undocumented \u201c$5,000 to save a life\u201d with sourced estimates and be explicit about what that number means (average vs marginal, which program, which region, what assumptions). Action: cite GiveWell/AMF cost-effectiveness estimates or a peer-reviewed source and use that as your starting point rather than a bare claim.\n\n2) Category error: you conflate \u201ccost to save a life\u201d with \u201ccost to prevent permanent disability\u201d without modeling the chain of events. Preventing a malaria death and preventing permanent neurological sequelae are different outcomes with different baseline risks and different marginal impacts of bednets. Action: state precisely what you mean by \u201cpermanently disabled,\u201d then either (a) compute cost per disability averted from first principles using parameters (baseline infection risk, probability of severe malaria given infection, probability severe malaria \u2192 permanent disability, bednet effectiveness, cost per net and protected-year), or (b) use GiveWell/AMF\u2019s published model if available. Give the formula you\u2019ll use so readers can inspect the assumptions.\n\n3) Missing counterfactual & metric choices \u2014 you need to address attribution, marginal vs average cost, uncertainty, and whether you prefer cost per case averted, cost per DALY averted, or cost per permanent-disability averted. Action: (a) explain why you picked a particular metric (DALYs are standard for morbidity vs mortality tradeoffs), (b) report a range/CI rather than a single point estimate, and (c) consider comparing AMF to other interventions that specifically reduce disability (e.g., treatment access, neurological rehabilitation) so readers can see opportunity costs.\n\nFixing these three issues will make the post much more useful and publishable while keeping it short: cite the source for your starting numbers, define the outcome, run a transparent calculation (or link to GiveWell\u2019s model), and report uncertainty and metric choice.",
    "improvement_potential": "Identifies the key, substantive problems: an unsupported headline number, a category error conflating deaths and permanent disability, and missing counterfactual/metric choices. The suggestions are concrete and actionable (cite GiveWell/AMF, define outcome, show a simple model or link to one, report uncertainty). Fixing these would substantially improve clarity and correctness without unduly lengthening the post. Not a 10 because the author\u2019s intuition isn\u2019t provably catastrophic \u2014 it\u2019s fixable with straightforward sourcing and a short calculation."

    "explanation": "The post asks a clear, simple question in plain language and is very concise, which helps comprehension. However it has grammatical issues (title, phrasing), conflates different metrics (cost to 'save a life' vs cost to prevent 'permanent disability') without defining what counts as disability, and lacks context or sources for the $5,000 figure. To be clearer the author should define the type of disability, specify whether they want cost per case, DALY, or lifetime-care avoided, and cite the AMF estimate they are using."

    "explanation": "For EA Forum readers this is not very novel \u2014 it\u2019s a straightforward cost\u2011effectiveness question (cost per DALY/disability averted vs cost per life saved) that GiveWell/AMF and the community have addressed before. The only mildly new angle is the explicit focus on permanent disability rather than death, but that distinction is standard in EA analyses. For the general public it\u2019s moderately novel: most people haven\u2019t thought in terms of dollars per prevented permanent disability or about converting AMF\u2019s cost\u2011per\u2011life estimates into cost\u2011per\u2011disability, so the specific quantitative framing is less familiar."

    "explanation": "The post asks a sensible question but provides almost no reasoning or data. It asserts an (uncited) $5,000 per life figure and then infers that preventing permanent disability must be \"significantly less\" without defining disability, specifying baseline risks, or modelling how bednets/AMF reduce severe outcomes. There is no evidence on rates of malaria-caused permanent disability, the fraction of cases averted by AMF interventions that would otherwise result in long-term impairment, or program costs per severe outcome averted. To be credible the claim would need: clear definitions, baseline incidence of permanent disability from malaria in under-fives, effectiveness of nets/AMF at preventing severe disease, and cost-per-net (and delivery) to convert to cost per disability averted. As presented, support is very weak."

    "validation_notes": "Mixed / uncertain. The poster\u2019s number that AMF-like ITN programs save a life for roughly $3k\u2013$8k (so ~$5k is a reasonable rough statement) is supported by GiveWell\u2019s December 2023 estimates. However, the implicit claim that preventing a permanent under\u20115 disability from malaria would be \u201csignificantly less\u201d than preventing a death is misleading. Persistent, permanent neurological disability from malaria is much rarer (it mainly follows severe/cerebral malaria), so on a per-disability basis the expected cost to avert one long\u2011term disability through ITN distributions is substantially higher than the per\u2011death cost under plausible assumptions. Using GiveWell\u2019s illustrative program numbers (e.g. ~$1M averts ~47,000 child malaria cases and ~294 under\u20115 deaths in the Uganda example) together with published estimates of persistent sequelae (roughly 0.1\u20130.2 persistent neurological sequelae per 1,000 children per year in endemic settings, and 4\u201325% persistent deficits among cerebral malaria survivors depending on study), you get very rough cost-per-disability prevented on the order of tens to a few hundred thousand dollars (e.g. ~\\$1e5\u2013\\$2.2e5 per permanent neurological case averted under the conservative calculations shown). There is wide uncertainty in these numbers (heterogeneous study methods, setting differences, follow\u2011up duration, and GiveWell model assumptions), so the posterior is: the life\u2011saved figure is reasonably accurate, but the expectation that disability prevention must be \u201csignificantly less\u201d is likely incorrect.",
