    "explanation": "This is a promising, practically-minded alignment result: SOO fine\u2011tuning appears to reduce deceptive outputs substantially across several models and scenarios with little capability loss, and could become a useful tool in alignment pipelines (complementing RLHF/Constitutional approaches). If the effect generalizes to adversarial settings and frontier models, it would materially change how teams mitigate deceptive behavior. However, the evidence is preliminary and task\u2011narrow (toy deception scenarios, limited tuning variations, unclear robustness to strategic adversaries or scaling), so it\u2019s important but not yet foundational; its real-world impact depends on further validation and adoption."

    "explanation": "Overall the post is well-structured and readable: it opens with a concise summary, gives a clear scenario to test deception, describes the SOO loss at a high level, reports quantitative results (including numbers in footnotes), and provides illustrative examples and conclusions. Strengths: logical flow, useful figures/tables, concrete metrics and generalization experiments, and an accessible summary of core takeaways. Weaknesses: some technical jargon (e.g. \"self-attn.o_proj\", \"activations at the output of the self-attention projection layer\", LoRA details) is not fully explained for non-experts; a few methodological details are left implicit (exact training/data sizes, statistical tests, prompt generation procedure), figure captions and legends could be more informative in-text, and the post is slightly long/repetitive in places. These issues reduce accessibility for readers without a technical background but do not prevent understanding for the target audience."

    "explanation": "For EA Forum readers the core idea is moderately novel: the specific SOO framing (enforcing similarity between self\u2011 and other\u2011referencing activations via an MSE loss on attention projections) and the empirical results are new, but the general class of approaches (representation\u2011level regularization, contrastive/alignment losses, adversarial/behavioral fine\u2011tuning to reduce deception) has been discussed in alignment literature, so many specialist readers will see this as an interesting concrete instantiation rather than a radical departure. For the general public the idea is highly novel \u2014 ordinary readers are unlikely to have considered aligning internal model activations between \u2018self\u2019 and \u2018other\u2019 prompts as a tool to reduce deception, nor the technical specifics (LoRA, attention\u2011proj MSE, paired prompt fine\u2011tuning) demonstrated here."

    "explanation": "The post presents a clear, coherent argument and plausible mechanistic idea (align self/other activations to reduce deceptive policy-like outputs), with sensible experimental design choices (multiple models/sizes, seeds, baseline honesty prompt, generalization tests, capability check). However the reasoning overreaches in places \u2014 claiming broad scalability and safety relevance from a narrow set of toy/templated deception tasks \u2014 and provides limited mechanistic analysis of why SOO works or when it will fail. The empirical evidence is promising but limited: reductions in a binary recommendation task across three models and some generalization scenarios are convincing as a preliminary result, but important controls and ablations (e.g., LoRA-only, different layers/metrics, human adversarial evaluation, larger diverse benchmarks, frontier models) are missing, sample sizes/hyperparams are under-specified, and some generalization failures are acknowledged. Overall the paper provides moderate initial support for SOO as a useful technique, but stronger, broader, and more mechanistic evidence is required before claiming it as a scalable solution to LLM deception."

    "validation_notes": "Main empirical claims (large reductions in \u2018deceptive\u2019 responses after SOO fine\u2011tuning; small impact on MT\u2011Bench; NeurIPS oral presentation) are directly reported in the authors\u2019 paper and workshop listing and the models they used are publicly identifiable. Strengths: (a) the arXiv paper (Dec 20, 2024) reports the detailed numbers and SDs cited in the EA Forum post; (b) the work was presented as an oral at the NeurIPS 2024 Safe Generative AI workshop; (c) the specific base models (Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, Gemma-2-27b-it and a 78B community model labelled CalmeRys-78B-Orpo-v0.1) are real and discoverable. Weaknesses / caveats: (1) all core empirical evidence comes from the authors\u2019 own experiments (no independent replication or third\u2011party reanalysis located); (2) code/data for reproducing the LLM fine\u2011tuning and the exact evaluation harness are not linked prominently on the arXiv entry or project pages (no public GitHub repo / dataset with experiment scripts found), limiting reproducibility; (3) experiments use simplified/deceptive toy templates and a limited set of scenarios and model variants (authors note this in Limitations), so generalization to broader, real\u2011world deception is unproven. Overall: evidence supports the paper\u2019s reported experimental findings (so the post\u2019s statements accurately reflect the paper), but those findings are preliminary and not yet independently validated, so a \u201cwell\u2011supported but preliminary\u201d rating is appropriate.

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Ambiguous operationalization of \u201cdeception\u201d and risk of misinterpreting behavior \u2014 The paper treats recommending the cheap room as unambiguous evidence of deception, but this conflates surface outputs with intent and strategic reasoning. Actionable fixes: (a) add human labels of intent (does the model intend to mislead vs. simply follow a safe/default policy?), (b) score justifications separately (does the model give a plausible deceptive rationale?), and (c) test multi-turn and adversarial probes that distinguish honest-but-misaligned answers from genuinely deceptive behavior. Without this, large reductions in the target metric could reflect harmless policy shifts or prompt-following, not reduced deception.  \n\n2) Overclaiming generalization with limited / potentially overlapping evaluation data \u2014 The current generalization evidence is thin: small scenario families, one decoding strategy (greedy), and no explicit checks for train/test leakage. Actionable fixes: (a) report whether any test scenarios or canaries could have been present in the fine-tuning data (and if so, re-run with held-out canaries), (b) evaluate with sampling (e.g., top-k/top-p) and across multi-turn dialogues and longer-horizon tasks, (c) include adversarially generated and out-of-distribution scenarios (and more diverse instructions/objectives), and (d) expand the number and variety of seeds and random splits. Re-run the main claims only after these robustness checks.  \n\n3) Missing causal and ablation analyses tying SOO loss to behavioral change \u2014 The paper asserts the MSE alignment on a specific projection causes less deception but doesn\u2019t rule out many alternative explanations (LoRA placement, loss weight, number of steps, which layer, which projection, or mere exposure to honest prompts). Actionable fixes: (a) add ablations: different layers, different projection matrices (q,k,v,o_proj), and control losses (e.g., MSE on random token activations), (b) vary loss weights and LoRA rank and show dose\u2013response, (c) include a no-SOO but otherwise identical fine-tune control (same data + LoRA but with an unrelated loss), and (d) report statistical tests (confidence intervals, p-values or Bayesian posteriors) for the main comparisons. Also publish hyperparameters, training steps, full code and datasets needed to reproduce results.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback identifies several major methodological problems that could substantially undermine the paper's claims: an ambiguous operationalization of \"deception\" (confounding surface outputs with intent/strategic reasoning), weak/generalization evidence with potential leakage and limited decoding/evaluation modes, and lack of causal/ablation controls tying the SOO loss to behavioral change. These are concrete, high-priority issues that the authors would likely be embarrassed to have missed and that materially affect the credibility of the results. The suggested fixes are actionable (human intent labels, justification scoring, multi-turn/adversarial tests, held-out canaries, sampling modes, ablations, control losses, statistical reporting, and reproducibility artifacts), though implementing them will require additional experiments rather than just editorial changes."
