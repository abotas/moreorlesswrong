    "explanation": "Useful but niche and highly uncertain. The post is a targeted, technical refinement to an EA-internal funding argument (how reductions in human mortality interact with calorie consumption to affect agricultural land and invertebrate welfare). If correct it modestly changes cost-effectiveness estimates for a specific fund (HIPF) and informs tradeoffs between human- and invertebrate-focused interventions, so it matters for some allocation decisions within EA. However it rests on many weak causal assumptions, ad hoc parameter guesses (including AI estimates), and small absolute impacts, so it is not foundational to major EA/worldview debates and has negligible direct relevance to the general public."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Don\u2019t rely on AI \"best guesses\" for what fraction of observational associations are causal. A large part of your numerical conclusions (SSBs, sodium, red meat, alcohol) depends on those causal fractions. Actionable fix: replace Gemini estimates with literature-based ranges (e.g., Mendelian randomisation, meta-analyses, GBD comparative risk assessments) or present wide, explicit sensitivity ranges (e.g., 0\u2013100%, 0\u201350%, 25\u201375%) and show how your headline results move. Run a simple sensitivity/robustness table (or a one\u2011way tornado) so readers can see how much the cost\u2011effectiveness claims hinge on these assumptions.  \n\n2) Rework the epidemiological/ mortality conversions \u2014 the current method (multiplying relative risk by the global per\u2011person daily death rate and a single average YLL per death) is too crude and likely biased. Actionable fix: compute absolute life\u2011years lost using cause\u2011specific baseline incidence and age\u2011structured life\u2011tables or use GBD attributable deaths/YLLs for the relevant exposures. For example, for red meat and SSBs use cause\u2011specific mortality (CVD, diabetes, cancer) and the corresponding YLL per death rather than the global all\u2011cause death rate and average YLL. If a full life\u2011table is infeasible, at minimum: (a) use cause\u2011specific death rates and YLLs from GBD for the pathways your exposure affects, and (b) present uncertainty from age and regional heterogeneity (e.g., US vs global). This will materially change the per\u2011unit life\u2011minute estimates and therefore the downstream land and cost\u2011effectiveness numbers.  \n\n3) Revise the agricultural\u2011land accounting and substitution assumptions (and show sensitivity). Actionable fix: (a) explicitly model what consumers substitute when SSBs or red meat decline (water, artificially sweetened drinks, other calories) and show alternatives, (b) use more complete life\u2011cycle / co\u2011product accounting for HFCS and feed corn (regional yields, by\u2011product allocation), and (c) for meat, disaggregate pasture vs feedlot/soy inputs and use FAO/GLOBIOM/OurWorldInData regional land\u2011use per kg values rather than a single global average. At minimum, present a best/worst case range for land change (e.g., replacement with poultry vs plant\u2011based staples) and note demographic feedbacks (longer lives \u2192 lifetime consumption changes, fertility and population dynamics) you are ignoring.  \n\nAddressing these three points (replace AI causal guesses with literature/ranges; use cause\u2011specific life\u2011table/GBD methods; and make land\u2011use/substitution assumptions explicit and sensitivity\u2011tested) will eliminate the largest methodological weaknesses and make the post publishable and defensible.",
    "improvement_potential": "Targets the post's biggest methodological weaknesses: (1) relying on AI 'best guesses' for causality (a clear own\u2011goal), (2) using an overly crude all\u2011cause RR \u2192 life\u2011years conversion rather than cause\u2011specific, age\u2011structured/GBD methods, and (3) simplistic land\u2011use and substitution accounting. Implementing these fixes would materially change the per\u2011unit life\u2011minute and land estimates and make the cost\u2011effectiveness claims much more defensible, though they will require extra analysis and length."

Weaknesses: it is dense and technical, relies on many assumptions (sometimes from speculative sources like Gemini) that are not always highlighted, repeats recommendations, and uses long paragraphs and many numerical details that make it harder for non\u2011experts to follow. The table has some blank cells and several steps could be summarized to improve conciseness and argument clarity.

    "explanation": "For an EA/readership familiar with microlife-style risk accounting, QALYs, and cost\u2011effectiveness tradeoffs between human and animal interventions, most components are familiar \u2014 but the specific assembly is somewhat novel: converting per\u2011unit mortality risks into person\u2011minutes, then mapping those mortality changes onto global agricultural land effects and invertebrate welfare, and combining that with calorie\u2011replacement effects to re\u2011estimate HIPF cost\u2011effectiveness. The underlying input data and conceptual pieces (diet risks, land per calorie, microlives) are well known, so the post is more an original recombination and applied calculation than a brand\u2011new idea. To a general educated reader, however, the linkage from tiny changes in consumption \u2192 life\u2011minutes \u2192 global agricultural land \u2192 invertebrate welfare (and the resulting funding recommendation) is fairly novel and unlikely to have been widely considered."

    "explanation": "Strengths: the post is transparent and systematic, cites relevant studies and data sources, and walks through arithmetic clearly so assumptions are visible. It attempts to connect mortality effects, calorie intake, and land use in a coherent framework. Weaknesses: many key causal inputs are uncertain or speculative (the author repeatedly uses guessed causal fractions from an LLM and unanswered email queries), replacement-food assumptions are simplistic, and heterogeneous data (long-term cohort relative risks, global per-day death rates, country-specific land-use figures) are combined in ways that are not fully justified. The analysis lacks formal uncertainty or sensitivity analysis, and some methodological steps (e.g., treating cohort relative risks as immediate per-day risk multipliers) are debatable. Overall the calculation is informative as a back-of-envelope exercise but is not strong enough to definitively support the quantitative conclusions without clearer causal evidence and robustness checks."

    "validation_notes": "Mixed / uncertain. Many of the paper-level effect-size inputs the author uses are supported by reputable sources (e.g., the SSB \u2192 all-cause mortality dose\u2013response from Wang et al. 2022; the red\u2011meat \u2192 mortality meta\u2011analysis; the microlife/micromort style conversions), and the author\u2019s use of IHME/GBD and Our World in Data numbers (deaths, YLLs, agricultural area per capita, corn yields) is in line with public data. However, two important problems substantially weaken confidence in the numerical conclusions: (1) the author\u2019s conversion of meat land\u2011use numbers appears to have a units/scale error (their stated 336 m\u00b2\u2011year per 100 g \u201cbeef\u201d is ~10\u00d7 larger than the commonly cited Poore & Nemecek / Our World in Data figures, which are roughly hundreds of m\u00b2 per kg of beef (i.e. ~30\u2013330 m\u00b2 per kg depending on metric and system) \u2014 this implies a likely large arithmetic/unit mismatch that materially changes the agricultural\u2011land results; (2) several causal fractions (e.g., what fraction of the SSB\u2013mortality or sodium\u2192SSB associations are causal) are taken from an AI guess (Gemini) or ad hoc assumptions rather than empirical identification \u2014 these are speculative and drive much of the author\u2019s \u201clife\u2011years lost \u2192 land\u201d chain.  Strengths: uses peer\u2011reviewed meta\u2011analyses (Wang 2022 for SSBs; Wang/others 2015 for red meat), standard burden data (GBD/IHME) and OWID agricultural data. Weaknesses: unit/scale inconsistency in land\u2011use numbers for meat (likely a factor\u2011of\u201110 error), reliance on assumed causal fractions without empirical justification, and cascading assumptions (daily RR \u2192 per\u2011day death risk \u2192 YLL per death \u2192 minutes lost \u2192 land per cap) that amplify uncertainty. Overall: many component data sources are valid, but key numeric steps (units conversion for meat land use and arbitrary causal fractions) reduce the post\u2019s empirical reliability.",
