    "explanation": "This is a low-stakes, practical request: useful for students who want to apply statistics to priority causes and for building relevant skills and awareness within the EA community, but not load-bearing. If acted on it can produce helpful student projects, small evidence or outreach benefits, and modest capacity building, yet it does not change foundational beliefs or large-scale policies. For general humanity it's of marginal direct importance \u2014 mainly a learning exercise rather than something that would materially affect global outcomes."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Too broad / underspecified project selection \u2014 pick a single, concrete question that matches the statistical methods your course expects. Right now the post lists many big topics but no concrete research question, dataset, or feasible scope. Actionable fix: propose 2\u20133 concrete mini-projects (each with one clear hypothesis, the dataset and a short note on methods). Example: \u201cDoes the introduction of state-level mask mandates reduce weekly COVID-19 case growth?\u201d \u2014 dataset: Our World in Data + OxCGRT or state public-health dashboards; method: difference\u2011in\u2011differences or interrupted time-series with state fixed effects. Another example: \u201cIs higher per\u2011capita health expenditure associated with higher life expectancy after adjusting for GDP and education?\u201d \u2014 dataset: World Bank + WHO; method: multiple regression with covariates. Including 1\u20132 concrete examples will make it much easier for classmates/instructors to assess feasibility and alignment with course goals.\n\n2) Missing ethics/privacy and data availability checks \u2014 several of your topic ideas (disease spread, interventions, conflicts) can involve sensitive or identifiable information or require licensing/permission. Actionable fix: explicitly state you will only use publicly available, aggregated datasets (link to sources) or confirm instructor/IRB approval if using human-subjects data. Add a short checklist in the post: (a) data source and license, (b) whether data are aggregated/anonymized, (c) reproducibility plan (code + data link), (d) any IRB/instructor clearance needed.\n\n3) Overlooking causal-inference limitations and statistical-practice issues \u2014 readers may expect claims about effectiveness/impact, but many EA-relevant questions are observational and vulnerable to confounding, multiple comparisons, and p-hacking. Actionable fix: tell readers you will (a) avoid strong causal language unless you use appropriate designs (RCT, natural experiment, DiD, regression discontinuity, etc.), (b) pre-register or state your analysis plan, (c) run robustness checks and report effect sizes with confidence intervals (not just p-values), and (d) do a simple power/sample-size check to ensure the question is answerable with the available data. Including these safeguards in the post will improve credibility and help peers give better dataset/method suggestions.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback identifies the key weaknesses: the post is too vague about specific questions/datasets (making it hard for others to give useful suggestions), it omits ethics/data-availability considerations, and it overlooks causal-inference and statistical-practice issues that matter for EA-relevant claims. Each point is actionable (concrete mini-project examples, a short data/IRB checklist, and safeguards like pre-registration and power checks). These fixes are critical to making the post feasible and credible, though they don't imply the original idea is wrong\u2014merely under-specified\u2014so the feedback is highly useful but not wholesale game-changing."

    "explanation": "Overall the post is clear, well-structured, and concise: it gives course context, assignment constraints, and concrete example topic areas, and asks for dataset ideas. Minor weaknesses: a few small language slips ('consist on', 'age expectancy', 'mortal disease') and the request could be slightly sharper by specifying dataset size, allowed sources, analysis tools, or which EA priority causes the author most wants to target. Fixing those would push it toward a 9\u201310."

    "explanation": "This is a straightforward, practical idea that most EA Forum readers have seen before \u2014 using course projects to study priority causes and the listed dataset topics (disease spread, policy effects, intervention effectiveness, life expectancy, conflict, AI performance) are common and widely discussed. It's mildly less obvious to the general public that you can explicitly frame graduate statistics work around EA causes, and the specific suggestion to analyze advanced AI model scaling or regulation datasets is a bit more specialized, but overall the post contains familiar, low\u2011novelty suggestions."

    "explanation": "The post presents a reasonable and coherent idea \u2014 using a course assignment to study datasets relevant to EA priority causes \u2014 and gives several plausible topical suggestions. However, it lacks structure and depth: it doesn't propose concrete, tractable research questions, discuss data availability or feasibility, or acknowledge confounders and ethical constraints. No empirical evidence, citations, or example datasets are provided, so while the suggestion is sensible and practical in principle, it is weakly supported and would benefit from specific datasets, methodological guidance, and consideration of limitations."

    "validation_notes": "The post mostly makes practical suggestions (study disease spread, policy impacts, AI compute\u2013performance, armed conflict, life expectancy, intervention effectiveness) rather than asserting hard facts. Those suggestions are well-supported: public, research-grade datasets exist for each topic (WHO / IHME for mortality and life expectancy; JHU / OxCGRT for epidemic data and policies; ACLED / UCDP for conflict; Stanford AI Index, Hugging Face / PapersWithCode for AI model/compute information; ClinicalTrials.gov / Cochrane / RCT registries for intervention evidence). Main weaknesses: the post does not discuss common constraints (restricted or sensitive data, IRB/privacy requirements, causal-identification challenges), which are important for empirical work. Overall: ideas are realistic and verifiable, with caveats about access, ethics, and causal inference. ",
