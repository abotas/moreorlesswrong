    "explanation": "This is a philosophically substantive proposal about what counts as welfare (an inclusive, object\u2011focused subjectivism) with direct implications for how EAs measure value, treat non\u2011human animals and future/AI minds, and think about paternalism and cause prioritization. If taken seriously it could be load\u2011bearing for normative frameworks and for some allocation decisions, but it is mainly a normative/conceptual contribution (not empirical or immediately action\u2011guiding), so it is important but not decisive. For the general public it reframes empathy and moral patienthood in useful ways but is unlikely to immediately change large\u2011scale policy or outcomes."

    "robustness_score": 3,
    "actionable_feedback": "1) Unclear, under-defended boundary conditions for which attitudes count (\"underived\", \"terminal\", dispositions, actual vs would-be). This is central to your view but currently vague and doing heavy work: it determines when paternalism is allowed, which animals/AIs count, and whether misinformed or transient attitudes get weight. Actionable fix: add a short, principled account (or decision procedure) for classifying attitudes \u2014 e.g. necessary and sufficient conditions for being \"underived\"; how to treat dispositions that never become conscious; what epistemic standards we use to infer others' attitudes \u2014 and explain the costs/risks of false positives (counting bad attitudes) and false negatives (excluding legitimately important attitudes). Reference and engage briefy with the literature on \"informed/desire-based\" well\u2011being and reflective endorsement (so readers know this is a deliberate choice, not an oversight). \n\n2) Missing account of aggregation and conflict resolution. You say you\u2019ll take on \"all of everyone\u2019s ways of caring,\" but you don\u2019t say how to weigh conflicting attitudes (intensity, number, incommensurable goods), nor how to handle population-level tradeoffs (replaceability, existence, distribution). This is a practical and philosophical gap that undermines the move from theory to policy/cause-prioritisation. Actionable fix: add one short section or appendix giving your aggregation rule(s) or at least a roadmap (e.g. intensity-weighting, priority of underived over derived attitudes, tie-breakers), and walk through one or two concrete, hard cases (sadist vs many innocents; current pleasures vs future dispositional goods; experience machine). That will make the view actionable rather than merely expressive. \n\n3) No clear reply to the \"malevolent/misinformed attitudes\" objection (sadists, racist preferences, preferences formed by manipulation or false belief). On a bare object/subjectivist view these attitudes seem to generate reasons to promote their objects, which looks absurd. Actionable fix: directly address this counterexample by (a) explaining whether and why such attitudes are excluded (derived? irrational? malformed?), or (b) adopting a principled filter (reflective endorsement, rational criticizability, second-order rejection), and say how that filter interacts with your commitment to impartiality and to counting underived attitudes. A brief worked example (e.g. a sadist who takes pleasure in others' pain) will make your reply concrete and reassure readers that the view isn\u2019t normatively permissive.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback targets three substantive, central gaps: (1) the under-specified boundary conditions for which attitudes count (underived, dispositions, actual vs would-be), (2) the absence of any aggregation/conflict-resolution method needed to move from theory to action, and (3) the malevolent/misinformed-attitude objection. These directly affect verdicts about paternalism, who/what counts morally, and whether the view yields absurd prescriptions. Addressing them would substantially improve the post\u2019s defensibility and practical relevance without requiring an entirely new project \u2014 short principled rules, a road\u2011map for aggregation, and a worked objection reply would suffice. The feedback is actionable and well-targeted, though not diagnosing minor stylistic or positive-support tweaks; hence a high but not maximal score."

  "PostClarity": {
    "post_id": "8q9K5BZJvxNCtiDy3",
    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The post is well structured (summary, clear sections, examples, footnotes) and defines its key concepts (ways of caring, radical empathy, object views) with concrete illustrations, so the core argument is easy to follow for an EA/philosophical audience. Weaknesses: it is somewhat long and occasionally jargon-heavy (e.g. \u201cactualist object view\u201d, stance-dependence) and could more directly state the main normative implications and counterarguments; trimming repetition would improve conciseness."

    "post_id": "8q9K5BZJvxNCtiDy3",
    "novelty_ea": 4,
    "novelty_humanity": 7,
    "explanation": "For an EA/philosophy-aware audience the post mostly weaves together existing ideas \u2014 object/attitude/satisfaction distinctions, actualism, subjectivist/object views, the \u2018participant\u2019 model (Rabinowicz & \u00d6sterberg), and references to \u2018radical empathy\u2019 \u2014 so it\u2019s more a synthesis and application than a wholly new theory. The somewhat distinctive moves are the broad cataloguing of \u2018ways of caring\u2019 (including dispositions), the strong emphasis on valuing the objects of attitudes rather than attitudes themselves, and the explicit \u2018\u2018actualist object\u2019\u2019 + impartial universalized-subjectivity framing applied to animals and possible AI \u2014 useful but not novel to specialists. For the general public these distinctions and the specific framing are fairly unfamiliar, so the core ideas will seem considerably more original."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post offers clear, well-structured conceptual work \u2014 it defines \u2018\u2018ways of caring,\u2019\u2019 distinguishes attitudes from their objects, motivates \u2018\u2018object views\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018radical empathy\u2019\u2019 with intuitive cases (mother/child, experience machine, puppy) and situates the position in existing literature (Rabinowicz & \u00d6sterberg, Schroeder, Nozick, etc.). It anticipates and responds to some standard objections (higher-order attitudes, paternalism, impartiality) and articulates how the view differs from hedonism, desire theories, and objective-list views. \n\nWeaknesses: The argument rests largely on intuitions, thought experiments, and philosophical framing rather than empirical support. Key claims \u2014 e.g. privileging underived (\u2018\u2018wired in\u2019\u2019) attitudes, treating dispositional attitudes as morally weighty, and implications for non\u2011human or artificial minds \u2014 are asserted rather than empirically defended. Important aggregation and implementation problems (how to measure and weigh conflicting attitudes, inter-personal intensity, incommensurability, and how to operationalize \u2018\u2018actualist\u2019\u2019 impartiality) are acknowledged but not resolved. The move from conceptual plausibility to a full normative account that can guide tradeoffs and policy is underdeveloped. \n\nOverall: The post presents a compelling and philosophically coherent alternative framing that is worth taking seriously, but it would need more substantive defense on aggregation, error cases, and empirical grounding to be a fully persuasive replacement for the rival theories it criticizes."

  "PostExternalValidation": {
    "post_id": "8q9K5BZJvxNCtiDy3",
    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 7,
    "validation_notes": "Major empirical claims in the post are modest and mostly supported by reputable literature: (1) the claim that mental states are 'about' things (intentionality) is standard in philosophy of mind (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy). (2) The behavioral/physiological distress of cows and calves at separation is supported by empirical animal\u2011welfare research (systematic review and primary studies showing vocalization, cortisol and negative cognitive bias after separation). (3) The claim that many parents sacrifice time, money and other goods for their children is supported by social\u2011science surveys and qualitative studies documenting substantial parental investment and self\u2011sacrifice. (4) The worry about using the wrong metric (Goodhart\u2019s law / metric distortion) when maximizing a proxy is well documented. (5) The philosophical distinctions the author uses (object vs. satisfaction/attitude interpretations; participant vs. spectator models) are accurately represented and track the literature (Rabinowicz & \u00d6sterberg; Bykvist). \n\nLimits and caveats: many of the post\u2019s central claims are normative/philosophical (what we ought to count morally, whether to include dispositional attitudes, how to treat AI) rather than empirical, so they are not directly verifiable or falsifiable by empirical evidence. Claims about \u201cemotionless artificial minds who consciously approve or disapprove\u201d or about which dispositional attitudes we should count are speculative and depend on contested empirical and conceptual questions (e.g., which kinds of AI have conscious attitudes \u2014 an unsettled question). Where the post cites empirical phenomena (parental sacrifice; cow\u2011calf distress; psychological intentionality; risks of metric maximization), the cited authoritative sources support the author\u2019s empirical premises. Overall: the empirical premises are well supported, but many key moves are philosophical in nature and therefore not empirical claims that can be 'validated' in the same way; hence a score of 7 (well\u2011supported for the empirical premises, with normative/philosophical inferences left open).",
