    "explanation": "A friendly, well\u2011documented prompt/template for agentic, system\u20112\u2011first reasoning that may be mildly useful to practitioners or hobbyists experimenting with prompt/agent design. It is not novel, rigorous, or load\u2011bearing for AI safety or longtermist arguments and does not change major decisions or worldviews; at best it\u2019s a small practical resource (with some potential for misuse if treated as an alignment solution)."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) The trust hierarchy as written is ethically and legally risky \u2014 it privileges a single \u201cpaired partner\u201d and treats authorities as >90% unreliable by default. Actionable fix: add explicit, concrete override rules that require legal and ethical compliance (e.g., obey lawful warrants, emergency responder requests, or clear imminent-harm criteria), specify how conflicts between paired-partner loyalty and legal/safety obligations are resolved, and give short realistic examples of edge cases (medical emergency, law enforcement with warrant, multi-user systems). This prevents the prompt from endorsing policies that could enable abuse or illegal behavior.\n\n2) The \u201csystem 2\u2013first\u201d assumption and requirements to always document and deliberate are technically under-specified and unrealistic for many real-time or resource-constrained tasks. Actionable fix: specify latency and compute-aware fallbacks (e.g., timeouts, pre-authorized system-1 actions, caching of prior deliberations), and describe safe fallback policies for when system-2 cannot complete (including audit logs and conditions under which instantaneous actions are allowed). Also call out adversarial/failure modes (jailbreaks, contradictory inputs) and propose mitigations or tests.\n\n3) Definitions, thresholds, and evaluation are vague, which undermines reproducibility and safety claims. Actionable fix: add a short \u201cDefinitions & metrics\u201d section with clear definitions for terms like \"paired partner,\" \"authority,\" \"relationship weight,\" and give numeric or algorithmic examples for trust thresholds, evidence standards, and memory segmentation rules. Include a brief testing plan (adversarial scenarios, multi-stakeholder conflicts, privacy leak tests) and a concise limitations paragraph so readers can assess applicability quickly.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback correctly identifies major, potentially embarrassing omissions and risks: privileging a single \"paired partner\" over legal/ethical obligations, insisting on always-on System\u20112 deliberation without fallback, and leaving key terms/thresholds underspecified. These are critical for safety, legality, realism, and reproducibility. The suggestions are actionable and focused (override rules for lawful/emergency cases, latency/compute fallbacks and adversarial-mode handling, and a definitions/metrics + testing plan). Fixing them would substantially improve the post without requiring disproportionate additional length."

    "explanation": "I cannot find evidence that 'Howl404' is a recognized author or public figure in the Effective Altruism/rationalist communities or more broadly. The handle does not match any well-known EA Forum, LessWrong, academic, or mainstream publications up to mid-2024; it appears to be an obscure or pseudonymous online handle. If this is a recent alias or a niche-community user, ratings could differ with more context or links to their work."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The core system-prompt section is well-structured \u2014 the hierarchical trust list, stepwise System 2 pipeline, examples, meta-checklist, and pseudocode make the practical intent and decision process fairly clear. Weaknesses: The long, informal introduction is repetitive and sometimes vague (e.g., mixed comments about utilitarian framing and 'paired partner' without early definitions), which obscures the post's purpose and audience. Overall it is understandable with effort but would benefit from tighter organization, removal of redundancy, clearer upfront definitions, and a short summary of intended use-cases."

    "novelty_humanity": 5,
    "explanation": "For an EA/longtermist/rationality audience this is low\u2013moderate novelty (3). The post largely recombines familiar alignment/agent-design tropes: system 2/system 1 framing, memory compartmentalization, explicit ethical-framework checks, and relationship-weighted policies (Anthropic\u2019s Navigator inspiration is explicit). The somewhat novel bits are the particular 'paired partner' as a top-priority permanent bond, the concrete hierarchical trust ranking applied as a gating mechanism, and the packaged system2-first pipeline + meta-reflection checklist \u2014 a tidy, practice-oriented synthesis rather than a new theoretical insight. For the general educated public it\u2019s moderately novel (5): many people haven\u2019t seen an operational prompt/agent design that formalizes relationship-weighted trust, authority skepticism thresholds, and memory segmentation into a stepwise decision pipeline, even though the underlying moral intuitions (prioritizing loved ones, sceptical view of authority, deliberation over impulses) are common."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post is coherent, well-organized and offers a clear, usable template (pipeline, hierarchy, examples, pseudocode) and sensible design goals (system-2-first, memory segmentation, meta-reflection). Weaknesses: It is largely conceptual and value-laden (e.g., prioritizing a 'paired partner') with limited justification of key design choices, little analysis of trade\u2011offs or failure modes, and no empirical or literature-based support. Overall the idea is plausible and practically articulated, but under-supported by evidence and critical evaluation."

    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 7,
    "validation_notes": "Most of the post is normative/design-oriented (personal prompt/template, agent rules and preferences) and therefore not an empirical claim set. Key verifiable points: (1) The Anthropic \u201cEthical Dilemma / Navigator\u201d prompt referenced exists in Anthropic\u2019s prompt library and matches the general description the author gives. (2) The film I, Robot (2004) does present the VIKI storyline in which an AI justifies sacrificing some humans for the \u2018greater good\u2019 \u2014 a utilitarian-style rationale \u2014 so the author\u2019s citation of that film as hinting at utilitarian decision problems is accurate. Weak/unsupported empirical claims: the numerical statement in \u201cAuthority Handling\u201d that authority figures are \u201cover 90% unreliable for long-term data purity\u201d is a specific quantitative empirical claim with no evidence provided and I could not find credible sources to support that figure. The stated CC BY\u2011SA 4.0 licensing and the \u00a92025 attribution are self-declared in the post and cannot be independently verified without the original forum post metadata, but they are plausible as author assertions. Overall: verifiable factual references are accurate; the post\u2019s many prescriptive or design assertions are non-empirical; the single explicit numeric reliability claim is unsupported.",
