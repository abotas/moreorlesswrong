    "explanation": "This is a personal career-advice post from a motivated high\u2011schooler. It\u2019s useful to the EA community insofar as it signals a potential recruit and highlights the demand for actionable, age\u2011appropriate guidance (so it has modest practical value for outreach and mentoring). However, it doesn\u2019t advance new arguments or evidence that would shift community strategy, nor does it contain claims with large downstream consequences. For general humanity it\u2019s essentially trivial \u2014 the direct impact is limited to the author and any people who respond or mentor them."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Make the post much more specific and narrow the ask. Right now it\u2019s a broad \u201cwhat should I do with my life?\u201d \u2014 that invites vague answers. Add 2\u20134 concrete constraints (location, intended degree, how long you can commit to a pursuit, risk tolerance, short/medium/long term goals) and 2\u20133 concrete options you\u2019re considering. Ask a targeted question (e.g. \u201cShould I focus on math/CS for AI safety or on biology for biosecurity?\u201d or \u201cHow valuable is spending 2\u20133 years on a CS undergrad before switching to AI safety?\u201d). This will let readers give actionable, relevant advice instead of generic encouragement.  \n\n2) Fix the apparent misunderstanding about the 80,000 Hours timeline. The quote you cite is a probabilistic/plausible scenario about when transformative AI might arrive, not a claim that AI safety careers stop being valuable after that date. If your worry is \u201cwill it be too late to start an AI-safety career after the 2030s?\u201d say that explicitly. If you want people to weigh timeline risk vs. other careers, ask them to compare specific trade-offs (career capital you gain now, alternative high-impact paths, how to keep optionality).  \n\n3) Give readers something concrete to respond to by listing what you can do now and asking for prioritized next steps. For a high-schooler that typically means: lean into math and programming, do small research/CS/Bio projects (GitHub, Kaggle, iGEM/biology competitions, independent experiments), seek mentorship/internships, join EA/student groups, and practice communication. In the post, list 3 project ideas or courses you could start this year and ask \u201cWhich of these would help most for X (AI safety / biosecurity / broad impact)?\u201d That turns vague curiosity into granular choices people can evaluate.",
    "improvement_potential": "Targets the post's main flaws: excessive vagueness, an important probable misunderstanding of the 80,000 Hours timeline quote, and lack of concrete next steps. Applying these suggestions would make the post answerable and actionable without much added length; they identify a potentially embarrassing misreading and clear 'own-goal' vagueness that currently wastes readers' time."

    "explanation": "Overall the post is understandable and has a clear goal (wanting to collaborate with ambitious people to do good) and concrete questions (what problem to focus on, what to study, whether AI safety is still a good career after the 2030s). Strengths: clear motivation, useful background details, and references to resources. Weaknesses: occasional rambling and stylistic phrasing (e.g. \u201canother question that just keeps swirling\u201d), one incomplete sentence about \u201cthe majority\u201d, and a slightly scattered structure with multiple related questions that could be grouped or prioritized. The AI-timeline question could be phrased more precisely. The post could be more concise by trimming personal asides and listing the specific questions numerically."

    "explanation": "This is a very common type of post: high\u2011schoolers asking EA/80,000 Hours style career advice, what to study, and whether AI safety remains worthwhile given timeline estimates. The timeline-specific worry and the author\u2019s interdisciplinary independent research (AI for antimicrobial peptides) are mildly distinctive, but the main questions and concerns are widely discussed both on the EA Forum and among the general public."

    "reasoning_quality": 3,
    "evidence_quality": 2,
    "overall_support": 3,
    "explanation": "The post is mainly a sincere request for advice rather than an argument defending a clear thesis, so its reasoning is limited and informal. Strengths: the author is reflective, motivated, and shows engagement with relevant resources (80,000 Hours, EA Forum) and domain work. Weaknesses: it makes a loose inference from an 80k sentence (plausibility of transformative AI by the 2030s) to a decisive career recommendation without analyzing counterfactuals, opportunity costs, skill accumulation, or uncertainty. Empirical evidence is minimal (self-reports of achievements and a single quoted claim) and insufficient to support claims about career impact under different timeline scenarios. To be stronger the post would state a specific thesis, lay out alternative models (e.g. early vs late transformative AI), and marshal evidence about career value, timelines, and how high-school actions affect long-term impact."

    "validation_notes": "Mixed/uncertain. Key factual claims fall into two groups: (A) verifiable background/field claims \u2014 these are well-supported (the quoted 80,000 Hours claim about AGI timelines is accurate; AI-driven discovery/design of antimicrobial peptides is an active, peer\u2011reviewed research area; Cambridge IGCSEs are normally a two\u2011year course; Cambridge 'Outstanding Learner' awards exist). (B) personal achievement claims (completing IGCSE Maths in 5 months, nomination for a Cambridge Learner Award, current independent research projects) are plausible but are personal statements that cannot be independently verified from public sources. Overall the post\u2019s empirical content is therefore partially verifiable (score reflects mixture of supported domain claims and unverifiable personal claims).",
