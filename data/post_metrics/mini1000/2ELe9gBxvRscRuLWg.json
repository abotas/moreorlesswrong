    "explanation": "The post is a moderately important methodological prompt for the EA/rationalist community: it exemplifies applying EA-style rough, transparent policy modelling to a real political question and invites iterative critique and refinement. That makes it useful and somewhat load-bearing for encouraging more policy-focused EA work, though the specific UK-prison conclusion is tentative and parameter-sensitive rather than foundational for EA priorities. For general humanity the post has limited scope and impact: if its conclusions were broadly accepted they could affect UK criminal-justice policy and many lives, but the analysis is highly context-dependent, ethically contested, and not of global scale, so its overall importance is modest."

    "actionable_feedback": "- Marginal vs average mistake / composition effects (big): you mostly compare average prison costs and cross\u2011country elasticities to infer the benefit of an additional UK prisoner. That\u2019s a large inference error: expanding capacity changes who is imprisoned, the marginal prisoner\u2019s crime risk is unlikely to equal the current \u2018\u2018average\u2019\u2019 or the marginal in US studies, and the cost of adding capacity (capital vs operating) and marginal policing/sentencing responses differ from the average cost you cite. Actionable fix: explicitly model the marginal prisoner (or present multiple scenarios: marginal = current average offender, marginal = less\u2011serious offenders, marginal = more\u2011serious), use marginal cost estimates (short\u2011run operating cost vs long\u2011run capital cost), and add a sensitivity table or Monte\u2011Carlo showing how conclusions flip as you vary the marginal composition and marginal cost assumptions.\n\n- Overly narrow benefit accounting / omitted social and ethical costs: you monetise prevented crimes using government estimates but largely omit other high\u2011plausibility costs and externalities (family disruption, long\u2011term health and employment harms, community\u2011level effects, childhood impacts, political/legal costs, and rights/deontological constraints). These could easily swamp or reverse your headline cost\u2011benefit numbers. Actionable fix: either (a) expand the benefit/cost side to include plausible estimates for these categories (even wide ranges), or (b) add an explicit section stating which externalities you omit and show a sensitivity analysis where these omitted costs are large enough to change the policy conclusion.\n\n- Weak causal generalisation from US/Italy studies to UK policy (identification and mechanism problems): the elasticity and Roodman style results rely on settings with different policing, detection rates, sentencing practices, and prison conditions. You also conflate short\u2011run incapacitation measured in reduced recorded crimes with long\u2011run crime reduction. Actionable fix: be much clearer about the causal assumptions (e.g., that elasticities estimated from cross\u2011jurisdiction shocks apply to a planned UK capacity increase), discuss likely mechanisms (incapacitation vs deterrence vs criminogenic effects), and either (a) incorporate UK\u2011specific studies or natural experiments where possible, or (b) show robustness checks that drop foreign studies or only use identification strategies plausibly relevant to the UK.\n\nIf you address these three points (add a small sensitivity appendix / revised spreadsheet that varies marginal composition, includes omitted costs, and flags which empirical estimates are UK\u2011relevant), the post will be much harder to credibly attack and far more useful to policymakers and EA readers.",
    "improvement_potential": "Targets the post\u2019s three biggest methodological weaknesses: treating averages as marginal (composition and marginal cost errors), omitting plausible social/ethical externalities from monetised costs, and overgeneralising foreign causal estimates to the UK. These are actionable fixes (marginal scenarios, sensitivity/Monte\u2011Carlo, explicit omitted items, clearer causal assumptions) that could materially change the conclusion; addressing them would substantially strengthen the post without requiring an unreasonably long rewrite."

    "explanation": "Overall the post is well structured, easy to follow, and makes its purpose and method clear: advocate for more rough policy modelling and illustrate it with a UK prisons cost\u2011benefit sketch. Strengths include explicit framing, useful signposting, transparent use of data and links, and a candid discussion of uncertainty. Weaknesses: some paragraphs are dense and numerically heavy (which may slow non\u2011technical readers), a few assumptions and transitions (especially US\u2192UK comparisons and the choice of valuation methods) could be made more explicit, and there are minor grammar/typo issues. The length feels appropriate for the topic but could be tightened in places for greater concision."

    "novelty_humanity": 4,
    "explanation": "For the EA Forum audience the core claim\u2014EAs should do more rough policy modelling\u2014is familiar and many Forum posts already apply EA-style cost\u2011benefit reasoning to public policy. The prison example mostly stitches together well\u2011known sources (Scott Alexander, Roodman) and common arguments about incapacitation vs rehabilitation, adding UK\u2011specific costings and a back\u2011of\u2011envelope elasticity calculation. That specific UK numerical application and the provocative tentative conclusion (that modest increases in UK incarceration might be cost\u2011effective) are somewhat fresh but not highly original to this readership. For the average educated person the piece is somewhat more surprising\u2014especially the claim that additional imprisonment could plausibly pass a narrow cost\u2011benefit test and the point that better rehabilitation can increase the case for incarceration\u2014but these are still within mainstream policy debates and build on existing literature, so overall only mildly novel."

    "reasoning_quality": 5,
    "evidence_quality": 4,
    "overall_support": 5,
    "explanation": "Strengths: The post is honest about uncertainty, clearly structured, uses back-of-envelope quantitative reasoning, cross-checks two different methods (Roodman-style per-prisoner estimates and elasticity estimates), and cites relevant literature (Roodman, country studies, Italy elasticity paper, Sweden/Norway examples). It sensibly highlights moral trade-offs and non-prison alternatives. Weaknesses: Major inferential leaps from U.S.-focused evidence to the UK margin are insufficiently justified; the two estimation approaches are not reconciled rigorously and rely on different assumptions (average vs marginal effects, offender heterogeneity). Cost comparisons use government valuations that are uncertain and may double-count harms/benefits; the post does not account for fixed vs marginal costs of expanding capacity, variation by offense type, dynamic and general-deterrence effects, or potential confounders in cross-country comparisons. Evidence is relevant but thin for the UK-specific causal claim and leans on mixed, heterogeneous studies rather than robust, directly applicable causal estimates. Overall: a useful, transparent illustrative exercise that raises plausible points but is not yet strong enough to support the definitive claim that increasing UK incarceration is cost\u2011effective without more careful modelling and UK-specific evidence."

    "validation_notes": "Most of the post's major empirical claims are well-supported by high\u2011quality sources. Key factual items \u2014 the UK Independent Sentencing Review (Oct 2024), the MoJ/HMPPS published prison unit cost (~\u00a351k per place in 2022\u201323), the Home Office unit\u2011costs of crime (2015/16 valuations used in policy analysis), World Prison Brief figures showing England & Wales have the highest imprisonment rate in Western Europe, David Roodman\u2019s review (arXiv) finding little net marginal public\u2011safety benefit from U.S. incarceration, the AEA (Barbarino & Mastrobuoni) Italy study on incapacitation elasticities, the Swedish distribution study, and Norway\u2019s fall in 2\u2011year reconviction rates \u2014 are all documented in reputable sources. \n\nCaveats / weaknesses: (a) Some numerical mappings in the post are rough back\u2011of\u2011the\u2011envelope calculations (e.g., converting Roodman\u2019s U.S. \u201cdevil\u2019s advocate\u201d crime\u2011prevention estimate into an expected \u00a3 benefit in the UK) and depend on assumptions (which the author acknowledges). (b) The timing/target for the UK \u201c14,000\u201d prison places is reported in government materials, but the target timetable in public sources is to 2031 (the post\u2019s wording \u201cmid\u20112020s\u201d is a minor timing mismatch). (c) Percentages for \u201ctop X% of population\u201d incarcerated are reasonable approximations but different sources/dates yield slightly different rates (UK \u2248130\u2013146 per 100,000; US \u2248500\u2013700 per 100,000 depending on year). (d) Applying U.S.-focused empirical results (Roodman) directly to the UK is plausible but uncertain \u2014 the international literature (e.g., Italy, Scandinavia) shows heterogeneity in marginal effects. \n\nOverall: the post is well\u2011grounded in the literature and official statistics; its central empirical claims are supported, but some quantitative inferences are necessarily uncertain and sensitive to assumptions.",
