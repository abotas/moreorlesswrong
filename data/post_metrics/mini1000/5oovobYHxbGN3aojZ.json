    "explanation": "This is a narrowly practical, tactical post: a template and quick theory of change for UK-focused advocacy on a specific aid cut. It\u2019s useful for UK-based EAs and people working on global health/development as a low-effort mobilization tool, but it\u2019s not foundational to major EA or policy debates (and the author argues it\u2019s unlikely to change the immediate outcome). The potential upside scales only if many people act, otherwise the direct impact is small \u2014 hence minor importance for EAs and low importance for humanity at large."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Unsupported, overconfident claim about impact (\u201cfait accompli\u201d / \u201calmost certain not to change anything immediately\u201d). Action: soften the language and make the theory of change explicit. Say what you actually expect campaigning to achieve (e.g. slow timetable for returning to 0.7%, media attention, party positioning) and on what mechanisms (constituent pressure on marginal MPs, backbench rebellions, select committee scrutiny, media). If you can, cite any evidence that constituent emails/letters affect MPs or policy, or label it as speculative. This prevents readers from dismissing the ask or following it under false expectations.\n\n2) No guidance on how to maximize impact (targeting, escalation, metrics). Action: add a few short, high-value tactics so the 5-minute ask is more likely to matter: who to contact first (your constituency MP; MPs on International Development/Defence/Foreign Affairs committees; marginal-seat MPs; party spokespeople), a recommended ask (e.g. request a written reply and a commitment on a timeline for restoring aid), when to escalate to a phone call or meeting, and how to track responses (e.g. simple table or ask people to paste replies in a central thread). Even 2\u20133 sentences per tactic will materially increase the campaign\u2019s chances and keeps length low.\n\n3) Missing quick rebuttals/alternatives and friction from an external template link. Action: include (briefly) the most likely counterarguments and one-sentence rejoinders (e.g. defence spending tradeoffs, manifesto constraints, public opinion) so senders can personalize convincingly. Also paste the core template text into the post or add a short extract so readers don\u2019t have to open a Google doc (reduces friction and privacy concerns); keep the external doc as an editable/extended resource.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback spots several important weaknesses that could materially reduce the post\u2019s effectiveness: an overconfident claim that may mislead or dissuade supporters, lack of concrete tactics to raise the chances that a 5\u2011minute action matters, and unnecessary friction from keeping the template only in a Google Doc. Implementing these changes is straightforward and wouldn\u2019t greatly lengthen the post, but would significantly reduce \u2018own\u2011goals\u2019 and increase actionability."

    "explanation": "Well-structured FAQ with a clear purpose, simple language, and an actionable template link \u2014 easy to follow and tells readers exactly what to do. Minor weaknesses: a few claims (e.g. 'fait accompli') could use brief supporting context, there is some slight repetition, and the post could more explicitly state the concrete ask and timeline to make the argument even sharper."

    "explanation": "The post is largely practical, tactical advice (use an MP-email template, low\u2011effort campaigning, realistic expectations about impact) that is standard in advocacy circles and has been discussed on EA Forum before (including around the prior UK aid cut). The mildly novel element is the specific tactical judgement about this particular procedural context (no parliamentary vote this time \u2192 unlikely to reverse immediately, but worth low\u2011effort contact to influence future returns to 0.7%). Overall the ideas are common and unsurprising to most readers."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post is logically structured, makes a modest, realistic recommendation (low\u2011effort constituent contact), and clearly states the likely limits of impact now while giving a plausible theory of change (signal future pressure to restore aid). It\u2019s practical (gives a template) and acknowledges tradeoffs (sympathy for defence spending). Weaknesses: Key claims are speculative and unsupported \u2014 e.g. that the decision is a fait accompli, that campaigning is \u201calmost certain\u201d not to change anything immediately, and that volume of constituent emails would affect future policy. The post provides no empirical evidence or citations about how effective MP emails or small campaigns are, no historical examples or numbers, and no analysis of political incentives or timelines. Overall, the recommendation is reasonable and low\u2011cost, but its persuasive force is limited by a lack of evidence about efficacy and impact."

    "validation_notes": "Most of the post's factual claims are accurate and verifiable. Reliable sources (UK government/Parliament briefings and major news outlets) confirm the UK government announced in Feb 2025 a planned reduction of Official Development Assistance from 0.5% of GNI to 0.3% by 2027 to help fund higher defence spending. Independent reporting and government/Commons Library material also confirm the 2021 reduction to 0.5% was subject to a Commons vote. The post's interpretation that this 0.3% decision is a government policy announcement not requiring the same kind of immediate parliamentary vote is broadly consistent with how the government implemented the change (the Commons Library briefings and written statements explain the statutory framework). The weaker claims are predictive/opinion (e.g., \u201ccampaigning is almost certain not to change anything immediately\u201d) which are plausible but not strictly empirical and cannot be proven; I treated them as analysis rather than factual statements. I did not verify the Google Doc template link itself.",
