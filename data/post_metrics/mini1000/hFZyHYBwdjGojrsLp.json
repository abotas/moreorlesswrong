    "explanation": "Practical, well-framed guidance on how to evaluate advice that is broadly useful and can improve decision quality, especially in higher-stakes or unusual contexts. However the points are largely commonsense and not novel or foundational \u2014 they won't materially shift major EA doctrines or humanity-level outcomes by themselves. The post is useful as a reminder and a portable checklist (more so for communities frequently making consequential choices), but it is neither groundbreaking nor critically load-bearing."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Make the framework actionable: the post is high\u2011level and reads like sensible instincts, but many readers will want concrete procedures they can actually use in conversation or under time pressure. Add a short checklist and a few simple heuristics (one\u2011line rules) such as: \u201cIf this action is high\u2011cost or irreversible, require two independent advisors with relevant domain experience,\u201d \u201cIf advice is low\u2011cost, treat it as a hypothesis to test quickly,\u201d and a 5\u20137 question checklist the asker can run through in <5 minutes (e.g. awareness? direct experience? incentives? reversibility? urgency?). This keeps the piece short but makes it practically useful.  \n\n2) Explain how to aggregate and prioritise conflicting advice: the post notes conflicts but gives no method for resolving them. Advise readers on aggregation strategies (triangulate across independent sources; weight by domain match and track record; prefer advice that includes mechanisms and counterexamples), and add a simple decision rule for prioritisation (e.g. expected value \u00d7 reversibility \u00d7 match with goals). Give one worked micro example (2\u20133 sentences) showing how to apply the rule to conflicting career advice so readers know how to use it.  \n\n3) Call out systemic incentives and power dynamics more directly, and give guidance on credential vs lived experience: you mention intention and background but underplay structural issues (gatekeeping, paid advice industries, epistemic injustice). Add a short paragraph on common incentive structures (paid coaches, recommender bias, status signals) and quick signals to look for (conflicts of interest, unusually homogenous perspectives, overconfidence without mechanism). Also advise when to prioritise lived experience over credentials (and vice versa) so readers can navigate whose advice to trust in new or marginalized contexts.",
    "improvement_potential": "Good, practical suggestions that fill the post\u2019s main weakness\u2014lack of actionable, operational guidance\u2014without substantially lengthening it. Adding a short checklist/heuristics, a concrete aggregation/prioritisation rule with a worked micro example, and a brief note on systemic incentives and lived experience vs credentials would materially increase the post\u2019s usefulness. These are not pointing out fatal errors, but they correct important omissions readers will notice."

    "explanation": "As of my knowledge cutoff (2024-06) there is no widely recognized EA/rationalist author or public intellectual known as 'Lin BL'. The name may be a pseudonym or a very minor/obscure online contributor; I could reassess if you provide links or context (papers, posts, or platform)."

  "PostClarity": {
    "post_id": "hFZyHYBwdjGojrsLp",
    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The post is well structured and highly comprehensible: it introduces the problem, presents a simple, memorable framework (awareness, experience, intention, outcome/utility), and uses concrete examples (quit your job) and a crisis-focused section to illustrate nuances. The argument is clear and persuasive \u2014 that advice should be assessed rather than blindly followed \u2014 and the guidance is practical. Weaknesses are mainly stylistic: the piece is somewhat repetitive and wordy in places, which reduces conciseness and could be tightened into a shorter checklist or decision flow for quicker reference. Overall it reads easily and is logically organized, but could be made more concise and punchy."

    "novelty_humanity": 3,
    "explanation": "The post is a clear, well-organized synthesis of familiar ideas (source credibility, incentives, fit-to-goals, cost/benefit, emotional/confirmation biases, and prioritisation). For EA readers these are standard meta-reasoning themes so the framing is not novel (hence very low score). For the general public it\u2019s slightly more useful than everyday conversation because of the explicit framework (awareness, experience, intention) and the emphasis on crisis-specific limits, but the underlying claims are common in self\u2011help, critical thinking and decision\u2011making advice, so still not highly original."

    "overall_support": 5,
    "explanation": "Strengths: The post presents a clear, coherent, and practically useful framework (awareness, experience, intention, outcome, utility) and sensibly highlights context-dependence, tradeoffs, and the special difficulty of crises. Arguments are structured, internally consistent, and grounded in plausible examples and heuristics. Weaknesses: It lacks operational detail (how to weight factors, decision rules), doesn't systematically address known cognitive biases or provide methods to test advice, and occasionally asserts normative recommendations (e.g. 'assume good intentions') without qualification. Evidence: the piece is mostly experiential and anecdotal with no citations to empirical research on advice-taking, expertise, or decision psychology, so claims are plausible but under\u2011substantiated. Overall: useful and well-reasoned as informal guidance, but limited by weak empirical support and lack of rigorous validation."

    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 8,
    "validation_notes": "Most of the post\u2019s empirical claims are broadly consistent with established findings in psychology, decision science, and social-network research. Key, verifiable points \u2014 that people tend to discount outside advice (egocentric discounting / reputation effects), that stress and negative emotions change how advice is given and received (reduced working memory, greater reliance on heuristics and conformity), that experts can be biased or overconfident and may become cognitively entrenched, and that social background/networks affect the applicability and availability of advice \u2014 are supported by peer\u2011reviewed literature. Weaknesses: the post is largely normative and heuristic rather than presenting precise empirical estimates, so some practical recommendations (e.g., exactly how much more cautious to be in crises, or the relative size of different biases) are not quantified and are presented as plausible guidance rather than hard facts. Overall the major empirical claims are well supported by literature, though the piece intentionally mixes evidence-based observations with author judgment and actionable advice.",
