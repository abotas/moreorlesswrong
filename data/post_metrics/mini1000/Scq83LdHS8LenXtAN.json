    "explanation": "This proposal is fairly important for the EA/rationalist community because it addresses a concrete, recurring problem EA funders and cause-prioritizers face: how to finance high\u2011risk, high\u2011social\u2011value research that is neither \u2018safe\u2019 for academia nor profitable for industry. If BIMs work as advertised they would change how philanthropists and impact investors allocate capital, create new leverage for neglected cause areas (global health, biosecurity, some kinds of AI safety research), and be a practical mechanism worth piloting. The idea is not foundational to EA worldviews, but it is load\u2011bearing for funding strategy and could materially shift priorities and returns on philanthropic capital \u2014 hence a high (but not maximal) score.\n\n  For general humanity the idea is of moderate importance. A functioning BIM framework could accelerate solutions to significant public\u2011health and technological problems and mobilize private money for public goods. However, the concept faces major practical and moral hazards (defining verifiable outcome criteria, gaming/perverse incentives, verification, IP/open\u2011science tradeoffs, regulatory/securities complexity, fairness and priority capture). Those implementation risks mean the concept is promising but speculative; it could matter a lot if scaled successfully, but that outcome is uncertain."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Verification, endpoint-definition, and perverse incentives are under-addressed and pose existential risks. The proposal relies on clean, contest-like \"solved / not solved\" outcomes (e.g., \u201cFDA-approved treatment that reduces decline by 40%\u201d), but real scientific breakthroughs are messy, incremental, multi-dimensional, and easy to game. Investors with large stakes could: push for narrow endpoints that are easy to meet but clinically useless; accelerate unsafe shortcuts (skipping replication or safety checks); conceal negative results; or collude with adjudicators. Actionable fixes to include in the post: (a) a robust design for staged/multi-criteria payouts (milestones + final verification) rather than single binary payouts, (b) independent multi-stakeholder verification committees with pre-committed adjudication rules, conflict-of-interest rules, and appeals processes, (c) audit, replication, and penalties (financial clawbacks, barring future participation) for fraud or non-reproducible claims, and (d) examples showing how these would work for a messy domain (e.g., clinical trials with safety endpoints). Adding one short worked example of a staged payout would greatly improve credibility.\n\n2) The donor-investor pay structure and political economy are insufficiently justified and could undermine uptake. As described, donors fund the outcome pool but investors (including wealthy speculators) reap financial returns when breakthroughs occur. Why would donors accept that charitable money partly becomes investor profit? How do you prevent wealthy donors or investor coalitions from steering priorities toward projects that serve their interests? Actionable fixes: (a) explicit models for who contributes outcome pools and why (patient groups, government-backed matching funds, outcome-linked charitable tax incentives), (b) alternative payoff architectures\u2014e.g., capped returns, majority-of-payout-returns-to-charity, or reinvestment of investor profits into further research\u2014to reduce political friction, (c) a short paragraph on allocation governance to prevent capture (distribution rules, community representation, transparent priority-setting), and (d) an estimate of required pool sizes and typical expected investor ROI to show plausibility.\n\n3) Legal, regulatory, and market-manipulation risks are only briefly mentioned but are likely showstoppers unless addressed concretely. A market where participants actively influence the outcomes they trade in raises securities, gambling, insider-trading, and research-ethics problems. Also, expecting investors to reliably evaluate and fund high-quality basic research underestimates expertise and monitoring costs. Actionable fixes: (a) summarize explicit legal pathways and risks (U.S. securities exemptions, anti-fraud exposure, clinical-trial regulation conflicts) and what changes or structures are necessary (e.g., accredited-only participation, ring-fenced trusts, regulatory pre-clearance), (b) explain monitoring/governance structures that ensure scientific due diligence (scientific advisory boards funded independently, third-party technical reviewers, standardized due-diligence templates), and (c) point to or summarize precedents (e.g., advance market commitments, prize models, biomedical milestone prizes) and how BIMs would borrow or differ from them. Including one concrete legal/regulatory scenario (e.g., how a BIM for a new antibiotic would comply with FDA, SEC, and charitable-donation rules) will make the proposal far more actionable and credible.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback pinpoints the proposal's largest practical vulnerabilities\u2014endpoint definition/verification and gaming risks, the political economy of donors vs. investor profits, and legal/regulatory/market-manipulation issues. These are not minor stylistic or background points but potential showstoppers; the suggested fixes are concrete and actionable (staged payouts, adjudication rules, clawbacks, alternative payoff architectures, accreditation/ring-fencing, precedents). Addressing them would substantially increase the proposal's credibility and feasibility, and omission of these aspects would leave the author open to serious criticism or failure modes."

    "explanation": "Well-structured and mostly easy to follow: a short summary, clear headings, step-by-step mechanics, and a concrete vignette make the core idea accessible and persuasive. Weaknesses include a few typos and phrasing inconsistencies, occasional hand-wavy claims (legal/regulatory and implementation details are glossed over or deferred to appendices), and some repetition that slightly reduces concision. Overall the proposal communicates its purpose and mechanics clearly but would benefit from tighter editing and a bit more grounding on legal/empirical feasibility."

    "explanation": "Most components of this proposal are known: inducement prizes (XPRIZE), advance market commitments (vaccines), social-impact bonds, prediction markets for forecasting, crypto bounties/Gitcoin-style funding, and prior academic/folk proposals to use markets to fund science (e.g., Hanson-style ideas). For an EA/longtermist audience these building blocks and related trade-offs are familiar, so the post is only moderately novel. The more original twists are the specific market-structure: donor-funded outcome pools combined with private investors buying time-sensitive positions (annualized-return incentives that explicitly reward accelerating solutions) and the explicit mechanism design for investors to finance research directly and benefit from others\u2019 fundamental work. Those combinations and the practical/legal framing make it somewhat fresher to a general but informed public, who may know prizes but are less likely to have seen this particular blend of prediction-market dynamics + time-discounted payouts applied to research funding."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post lays out a clear, logically coherent mechanism that plausibly addresses real weaknesses in existing funding systems (funding gaps for high\u2011risk, noncommercial research). It leverages well\u2011known properties of prediction markets (information aggregation, financial incentives, time sensitivity) and provides a concrete implementation pathway and an illustrative narrative, which helps make the idea tangible. Weaknesses: Key causal claims are asserted but not empirically demonstrated. The analogy between prediction markets for forecasting and markets that create outcomes is underdeveloped; the post does not address numerous implementation and incentive risks in depth (gaming the verification criteria, perverse incentives to rush poor science, free\u2011riding, intellectual property and collaboration dynamics, selection bias toward easily measurable outcomes, availability of sufficiently large outcome pools, investor behavior in long\u2011horizon science). Empirical evidence is thin: mostly high\u2011level examples (Genome Project, CRISPR) and conceptual arguments rather than data, pilots, simulations, or case studies showing BIM\u2011style markets reliably accelerate complex scientific breakthroughs. Overall, the proposal is an interesting and plausible idea worth piloting, but currently under\u2011supported by empirical evidence and missing detailed mitigation of important practical and strategic risks."

    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 7,
    "validation_notes": "Most of the post's empirical claims are reasonably well-supported by existing evidence, but a few are time-sensitive or over-simplified. Strengths: (1) Prediction markets reliably aggregate dispersed information and have performed well in forecasting tournaments (Good Judgment Project / IARPA / SciCast) \u2014 supporting the claim that markets can aggregate knowledge. (2) Existing incentive/pull mechanisms (advance market commitments, inducement prizes like XPRIZE) and crowdfunding for science show there are real-world precedents for non\u2011traditional, outcome\u2011focused funding. (3) Historical examples cited (Human Genome Project completion ahead of schedule/under budget; long history of amyloid\u2011focused Alzheimer\u2019s work and controversy around amyloid-targeting trials) are factually supported. Caveats/weaknesses: (A) The claim that \u201cover the past two months there has been a slew of scrutiny and cuts to scientific funding in the United States\u201d is time\u2011dependent and needs explicit dates and evidence \u2014 funding landscapes vary by agency and year; recent high\u2011profile regulatory/political events (and budget debates) exist but are not uniformly summarized by that phrase. (B) The legal claim that BIMs \u201ccould be implemented now with existing legal frameworks\u201d is partially true \u2014 there are legal pathways (private placements, qualified\u2011purchaser funds, or regulated event/exchange routes) but each route carries nontrivial regulatory risk (Securities Act/Investment Company Act, state gambling laws, CFTC issues for event contracts); Kalshi litigation shows paths but also regulatory contestation. (C) Many claims about how incentives would behave in practice (e.g., markets necessarily produce collaboration or reliably fund very high\u2011risk fundamental research) are plausible but speculative and would depend heavily on market design, governance, verification rules and anti\u2011manipulation safeguards. Overall: major empirical building blocks cited by the author are supported by reputable sources, but implementation/legal/practical claims are plausible rather than proven and require careful design and legal review.",
