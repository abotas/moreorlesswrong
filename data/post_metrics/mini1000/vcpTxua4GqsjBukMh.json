    "explanation": "For the EA/ rationalist community this question is moderately-to-highly important because beliefs about whether an existential catastrophe would eliminate all animal sentience materially affect prioritization, risk modeling, and moral tradeoffs (e.g., emphasis on preventing total extinction vs protecting human civilization, and the weight given to wild-animal welfare). However, the post is a poll rather than a novel argument or evidence, so it is not foundational by itself. For general humanity the topic has large abstract stakes (losing all animal sentience would be catastrophic), but the specific EA Forum poll has limited direct impact on most people and policy today, so its practical importance is comparatively low."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Clarify key terms and scope before polling. The post hinges on ambiguous phrases: \u201canimal sentience\u201d (do insects, cephalopods, nematodes count?), \u201cwipe off\u201d (temporary unconsciousness, local extinction, global extermination, or permanent elimination of sentience?), and \u201cnext existential catastrophe\u201d (any x-risk event, or the next one to occur; what timescale?). Those ambiguities make votes hard to interpret. Actionable fix: give one clear definition you want respondents to use (or give 2\u20133 separate versions) and state whether you mean temporary vs permanent loss and whether small animals/insects count. Example phrasing to include: \u201cBy \u2018animal sentience\u2019 I mean organisms with centrally mediated conscious experience (vertebrates + cephalopods + insects? \u2014 pick one). By \u2018wipe off\u2019 I mean global elimination of all such organisms\u2019 sentience at the time of the event (even if life could re-evolve later).\u201d 2) Separate the epistemic question from the empirical/cause question and collect conditional answers. Right now the post mixes \u2018\u2018will the next x-catastrophe wipe out sentience?\u2019\u2019 with assumptions about cause (often ASI). Different catastrophes have very different implications. Actionable fix: (a) ask respondents to state which type of catastrophe they think is most likely next (ASI, engineered pathogen, nuclear, climate/ecosystem collapse, asteroid, etc.), (b) for each major type ask the conditional probability it would wipe out all animal sentience. Alternatively ask two explicit questions: \u201cWhat is P(next existential catastrophe is of type T)?\u201d and \u201cIf next catastrophe is type T, what is P(it wipes out all animal sentience)?\u201d This will make answers interpretable and allow you to analyze where disagreement comes from. 3) Improve poll design to reduce misinterpretation and bias. A simple agree/disagree poll encourages noise and selection effects (EA forum has many ASI-focused participants). Actionable fixes: ask for numeric probabilities (e.g. P > 0.5?), request respondents\u2019 P(ASI doom) or other priors so you can correlate answers, and invite short justifications or scenario sketches for high/low estimates. Also consider offering an explicit short baseline argument or examples (refugia, robustness of insects, difficulty of sterilizing the whole planet) so respondents anchor on the same considerations. These changes will make results much more informative and reduce \u201cown goals\u201d from ambiguous wording and confounded causes.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback correctly identifies major, high-impact problems: ambiguous key terms (animal sentience, 'wipe off', timeframe), conflation of the empirical question with which catastrophe is meant, and poll-design/selection biases. The suggested fixes are concrete (define terms, elicit conditional probabilities by catastrophe type, request numeric probabilities and priors) and wouldn\u2019t unduly bloat the post while making results interpretable and avoiding embarrassing misunderstandings. It misses a couple of minor points (e.g. explicit sampling/selection strategy and timeframe hedging), but overall addresses the main own-goals and would substantially improve the poll."

    "explanation": "Generally clear and easy to follow: the author gives context, motivation, and a concise restatement of what they're asking, and the note about excluding digital sentience is helpful. Weaknesses: some phrasing is awkward (e.g. \u201cwipe off\u201d), key terms and scope are slightly ambiguous (what counts as the \u201cnext\u201d catastrophe, precise definition of \u201cwipe out\u201d and whether >50% is intended by \u201clikelier than not\u201d), and a couple of grammatical slips make parts mildly harder to parse. Overall understandable but could be tightened and more explicit about definitions/assumptions."

    "novelty_humanity": 6,
    "explanation": "Among EA readers this is only mildly novel \u2014 discussions about extinction, ASI doom, and the moral importance of animal sentience are common, and people in the community have already debated whether catastrophic AI would eliminate biological or sentient life. The particular framing (a poll about whether the next X-catastrophe would wipe out all animal sentience 'in the moment', excluding digital minds) is a useful prompt but not a very original research idea. For the general educated public the combination of X-risk probability judgments with the specific claim that the next catastrophe is likely to immediately eliminate all animal sentience is moderately novel \u2014 many non-experts think about mass extinction or annihilation in general terms but are unlikely to have considered this precise sentience-focused, momentary framing or its connection to ASI probabilities."

    "explanation": "The post is primarily a solicitation of community views rather than an argument backed by analysis. Strengths: it states the question clearly, gives a useful definition of what 'wipe out' means (instantaneous loss, excluding future re-evolution) and notes scope (excludes digital sentience). Weaknesses: the core claims are speculative and based on anecdote (author's impressions of conversations), there is no systematic argument about mechanisms by which an existential catastrophe would or would not eliminate all animal sentience, no probabilistic modelling, and no empirical data or literature cited. The post also conflates different types of catastrophes (e.g. ASI vs other risks) without examining how they differ in their likelihood of sterilizing sentience. Overall the thesis is very weakly supported by reasoning and evidence in the post as presented."

    "validation_notes": "Mixed / uncertain. Strengths: empirical literature and reputable modelling show past mass extinctions (e.g., the K\u2013Pg/Chicxulub event) spared many small mammals, insects and aquatic animals, so the claim that typical natural catastrophes would \u2018wipe out all animal sentience\u2019 is contradicted by paleontological evidence (e.g., Scientific American / Univ. of Michigan coverage). Nuclear\u2011war/nuclear\u2011winter climate models predict catastrophic, long\u2011lasting global collapse of agriculture and mass mortality but do not imply sterilization of all animal life (Robock et al. 2007; FAS summary). Surveys of AI/technical experts (e.g., Grace et al. 2024) measure probabilities of extreme outcomes for humans but do not ask whether an ASI catastrophe would eliminate non\u2011human animal sentience, so the author\u2019s claim about this question being \u201csidelined\u201d is supported by an absence of direct polling. Weaknesses: there is no systematic, high\u2011quality published survey that directly answers the EA post\u2019s central empirical questions (i.e., how EA/AI\u2011safety communities as a whole answer the poll question, or whether people with P(ASI doom)>50% typically expect all animal sentience to be wiped out). Surveys that exist focus on human extinction or P(doom) and on heterogeneity of expert beliefs, not on outcomes for non\u2011human sentience, so the post\u2019s descriptive claims about community beliefs can\u2019t be reliably verified from public sources.",
