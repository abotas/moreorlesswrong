    "explanation": "This is a useful, moderately important reframing for AI safety: it highlights a real problem (the widening power\u2013ethics gap), stresses the under-emphasised task of value selection/moral alignment, and suggests useful terminology (sentientkind, human alignment, etc.). For the EA/AI-safety community it\u2019s not foundational or highly novel\u2014many researchers already worry about value alignment and ethics\u2014but it can help shift attention, broaden discourse (e.g. to non\u2011human sentience), and influence priorities and funding choices. For general humanity the claim is important in principle (if true it matters a lot), but the post itself is more of a conceptual prompt than a decisive roadmap, so its direct impact on policy or large\u2011scale action is moderate."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Don\u2019t overstate or mischaracterize key figures and the field \u2014 fix or soften the Yudkowsky claim and map existing work. You assert Yudkowsky \u201coperates within a framework where (almost) only humans are considered sentient\u201d and treat the AI-safety field as overwhelmingly control-focused. Those are strong factual claims about people and the literature that readers (and critics) will check. Actionable fixes: (a) either remove the specific claim about Yudkowsky or back it with precise citations (quotes/context) showing the relevant stance; (b) acknowledge and cite existing strands of value/moral alignment research (e.g., RLHF, Constitutional AI, Coherent Extrapolated Volition debates, machine ethics, work on multi-agent/value aggregation, welfare economics, animal welfare/vertebrate sentience literature, and relevant governance work) so your proposal sits in context rather than appearing to invent a gap the field already recognises; (c) if you mean there\u2019s an underemphasis, quantify or illustrate that with examples (funding, publications, workshops) rather than broad brush claims.\n\n2) Operationalize and support the central concept (\u201cpower-ethics gap\u201d). At present this is a compelling intuition but the post relies on rhetorical claims (e.g., \u2018\u2018increasing suffering and killing throughout history\u2019\u2019) without clear definitions or evidence. Readers will ask: how would we measure the gap, what time series or indicators support \u2018\u2018widening,\u2019\u2019 and how do alternative narratives (e.g., long-term declines in violence, improvements in health) fit? Actionable fixes: (a) define the gap precisely (variables, units, examples \u2014 e.g., technological capacity per capita vs. some proxy for ethical capacity or institutional maturity); (b) cite empirical literature (historical trends, moral progress scepticism, animal welfare science, metrics on governance capacity) or explicitly acknowledge uncertainty where evidence is weak; (c) if you lack hard data, reframe the claim as a hypothesis that motivates further research and give concrete, testable predictions.\n\n3) Engage the obvious normative and feasibility objections to \u201csentientkind\u201d/omnikind alignment. Moving from human-centric to sentientkind alignment raises difficult moral theory and implementation questions (whose sentience counts, how to trade off interests across species and future vs present beings, feasibility of value aggregation, risks of perverse incentives, governance/coordination challenges). The post currently presents the expansion to all sentient beings as a near-trivial moral extension. Actionable fixes: (a) acknowledge hard trade-offs and list the central philosophical problems (moral weight of non-human animals, scope of sentience, interpersonal and interspecies aggregation, epistemic uncertainty about sentience); (b) briefly sketch possible ways to proceed (e.g., adopt pluralist or lexicographic rules, constrained welfare-utilitarianism, decision procedures under uncertainty) or point to literature that tackles these issues; (c) if you propose new terminology (sentientkind, Omnikind AI, Buddha AI), say explicitly what problems those terms solve and how they would be operationalised in alignment research (not just aspirational labels).",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback targets major weaknesses that could embarrass the author (mischaracterising Yudkowsky/field, offering an uncited empirical claim about a \u2018power-ethics gap\u2019, and glossing over hard trade-offs of \u2018sentientkind\u2019 alignment). It\u2019s actionable and would materially improve credibility without necessarily bloating the post. It isn\u2019t a 10 because these fixes don\u2019t show the thesis is outright false \u2014 they refine and ground it \u2014 but they are important to avoid serious critique and to situate the contribution within existing work."

    "explanation": "The post is well-structured (TLDR, clear sections, and defined concepts) and communicates a coherent central thesis \u2014 the \"power-ethics gap\" and the need to foreground value-selection in AI \u2014 making it generally easy to follow. Weaknesses include occasional grammatical slips and awkward phrasing, some repetition, a few assertive claims (e.g., about Yudkowsky's stance) that would benefit from clearer sourcing or nuance, and several proposed terms that are underdefined or overlap; tightening language and more precise definitions would improve clarity and concision."

    "explanation": "For an EA/AI-safety audience this is relatively unoriginal: the core issues (capabilities vs alignment, value-selection/steering problem, expanding the moral circle, critiques of anthropocentrism) are already widely discussed. The post\u2019s contribution is mostly a reframing and new labels (\"power-ethics gap,\" \"sentientkind alignment,\" \"human alignment/moral alignment\") and emphasising human ethical development as a distinct target \u2014 useful but incremental. For the general public the combination of AI risk with a systematic ethical\u2011development framing and explicit proposals to align AI for all sentient beings is less commonly encountered, so the ideas feel moderately novel to an educated non\u2011EA reader."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post presents a clear, coherent conceptual framework (power vs. ethics vs. wisdom), draws reasonable attention to an important normative issue, and usefully proposes terminology and distinctions (e.g., value selection, sentientkind alignment). The argument that increasing capability without commensurate ethical development is risky is intuitively plausible and logically structured. Weaknesses: The post relies heavily on analogy and assertion rather than rigorous argumentation. Key claims \u2014 that ethical understanding is not keeping pace with power, that AI will substantially widen this gap, and that the AI safety field neglects the ethical dimension \u2014 are plausible but under-evidenced. Empirical claims (rates of ethical progress, scope of sentience, relative emphasis in the AI safety community) are not supported with data, literature review, or concrete examples. Some characterizations (e.g., of prominent figures' views or of the field's priorities) are presented as definitive without acknowledging existing research on ethics, value learning, and interdisciplinary work. Overall: conceptually useful but currently more of a provocative proposal than a well-supported empirical claim; would be strengthened by citations, data, and engagement with existing moral-alignment literature."

    "validation_notes": "Mixed/uncertain. Several empirical claims in the post are supported by high\u2011quality evidence (rapid growth in AI compute; huge and rising numbers of animals slaughtered annually; scientific recognition of sentience in vertebrates and specific invertebrate groups), while other empirical/empirical\u2011style claims are overstated or ambiguous (the claim that human-caused suffering and killing have increased overall through history is contradicted by prominent datasets showing declines in many forms of interpersonal and interstate lethal violence; the characterization of Eliezer Yudkowsky as treating \u201calmost only humans\u201d as sentient is an oversimplification of his nuanced writings on consciousness). The diagnosis that mainstream alignment work emphasizes technical control/robustness over broader moral/value selection is partially supported (many major actors prioritize technical alignment and capability\u2011safety), but there is also substantial work on ethics/value questions and multiple competing proposals (RLHF, Constitutional AI, CEV, value\u2011learning literature). Overall: the post combines well-supported empirical points with broader normative arguments and some overstated historical/general empirical claims, so a midpoint rating (5) reflects both supported and contradicted elements.",
