    "explanation": "This post is a moderately important niche contribution for the EA/rationalist community because it touches on topics that can materially affect how one does longtermist/AI-related moral arithmetic: the moral status of copies, how to count experiences, and how that interacts with MWI-style derivations of probability (which feed into decision theory and anthropic reasoning). If the tension is real and unresolved it could change how we evaluate scenarios involving duplicated conscious AIs or branching worlds, so it is worth attention from people working on population ethics, AI ethics, and quantum decision theory. For general humanity the piece is of low immediate practical importance: it is largely philosophical and speculative (depends on consciousness being copyable and on taking MWI seriously), so it would only become consequential in a future where those premises are empirically central."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Weakness: Vague / unstable definitions of \u201ccopy\u201d, \u201cphysical copy\u201d, and moral weight. Actionable fix: pick and state precise ontological and moral definitions up front \u2014 e.g. (a) what you mean by a copy (same classical bitstring, same functional organization, same quantum state, run on same vs different substrate), (b) what counts morally (per instance, per pattern, per unit of some measure). Many objections you anticipate reduce to different definitions. Make one explicit choice (or frame alternative definitions as separate cases) and analyze each, rather than relying on an intuitive but ambiguous notion of \u201ccopy.\u201d\n\n2) Weakness: Insufficient engagement with the MWI probability literature and the distinction between counting copies vs amplitude/measure. Actionable fix: directly address the main approaches to deriving the Born rule in MWI (Deutsch/Wallace decision-theoretic approach, Zurek\u2019s envariance arguments, Sebens & Carroll / Vaidman on self-locating uncertainty, Wallace on branches as measure-weighted). For each approach, explain whether and why your Ignore-Copies claim would or would not undermine it \u2014 e.g. does that argument rely on counting discrete branches or on amplitude-as-measure? Adding concrete citations and showing where \u201ccounting physical copies\u201d would enter the formal arguments will prevent the post from sounding like a hand-wavy intuition pump.\n\n3) Weakness: Overlooks the important distinction between (i) objective physical measure (quantum amplitude^2) that underwrites MWI probabilities and (ii) subjective self-locating credence about \u201cwhich copy I am\u201d. Actionable fix: add a short section separating (a) questions about objective ontological multiplicity (does running a program twice change the quantum measure?) and (b) indexical/epistemic questions about which instantiation an agent should expect to be. Work through simple toy cases (e.g. run program once in a branch of amplitude 1/\u221a2 vs run it twice in one branch, or run two identical copies in different decohered branches with equal amplitudes) showing when moral weight would plausibly change under (i) moral weight proportional to amplitude, (ii) proportional to count, or (iii) invariant under duplication. This will expose which empirical or philosophical premises you actually need for the tension to hold.",
    "improvement_potential": "Targets core omissions that could undermine the post\u2019s argument: vague/unstated definitions of 'copy' and moral weighting, failure to engage the central MWI/Born-rule literature, and conflation of objective amplitude-as-measure with subjective self-locating credences. Fixing these would clarify the claim, prevent the post from straw-manning MWI, and either resolve or substantiate the purported tension without requiring gratuitous length\u2014mostly targeted additions (definitions, citations, and a few brief toy cases)."

    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "Overall the post is clear, well structured, and concise: it sets up a concrete thought experiment, defines the central thesis (Ignore-Copies), states the goal (tension with MWI), and gives an intuitive toy example before promising a deeper argument. Strengths are the explicit premises and focused scope. Weaknesses are that it assumes familiarity with technical terms (MWI, Born rule) and the moral claim could use tighter definitions (what exactly counts as a 'copy' and what \"not well defined\" means). The casual aside about a \u201cbutchered re-statement\u201d and the promised continuation also leave some readers wanting a slightly more rigorous preview of the core argument."

    "explanation": "Among EA Forum readers this is moderately-to-highly novel: many have separately encountered issues about digital minds/duplication (Parfit-style duplication, population ethics, simulation arguments) and about Many-Worlds/Born-rule debates (Deutsch/Wallace, measure vs branch-counting), but explicitly drawing a tension between an \"Ignore-Copies\" moral view and common ways of motivating the Born rule is a less-discussed, relatively original melding of these literatures. For the general public it's highly novel: most people have not connected the ethics of copying conscious states to technical debates about MWI and probability, so the main claim\u2014 that denying moral weight to exact copies can undermine some MWI probability arguments\u2014will be new to almost all lay readers."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post raises a clear, interesting philosophical tension and frames it with intuitive examples; it correctly identifies where the intuitions behind counting copies could conflict with interpretations/derivations in MWI. Weaknesses: The excerpt contains mainly conceptual intuition and assertion rather than a fully worked out argument; key terms (e.g. what counts as a 'copy', how measure is defined in MWI) are not rigorously defined, alternative resolutions are not engaged, and no formal derivations or citations are provided. Empirical evidence is essentially absent \u2014 this is a philosophical rather than empirical claim \u2014 and the post does not yet marshal the technical literature (Deutsch/Wallace decision-theoretic arguments, Gleason-type proofs, envariance, self-locating uncertainty discussions) that would be required to substantiate the claimed tension. To strengthen the case it should (a) formalize the Ignore-Copies position, (b) analyse specific Born-rule derivations and show where copy-counting is presupposed, and (c) engage with counterarguments and relevant literature."

    "validation_notes": "Mixed / uncertain. The post is primarily philosophical rather than reporting new empirical facts, and most of its empirical premises are contested or unresolved. Key strengths: the literature on Everett/MWI shows an active debate about how to get the Born rule and explicitly warns against a naive \u2018count branches = probability\u2019 move (so the author\u2019s worry about a tension is well\u2011posed). Major weaknesses: (a) whether a digital computation can realise consciousness and whether perfect \u2018copies\u2019 of conscious states are possible/morally weightless is not an established empirical fact but a philosophical hypothesis (there are influential physicalist/functionalist accounts that make copying plausible, and competing views that deny it); (b) MWI is an interpretation \u2014 not empirically established as the unique correct theory \u2014 and derivations of the Born rule within MWI (Deutsch decision\u2011theory, Zurek envariance, Sebens & Carroll self\u2011locating uncertainty) are contested but do exist, and most do not rely on naive counting of identical physical copies. Overall: the post\u2019s characterization of a tension is reasonable and grounded in existing literature, but its empirical premises (possibility of conscious digital copies; truth of MWI) are unsettled, so the claim cannot be strongly validated or falsified with current evidence.",
