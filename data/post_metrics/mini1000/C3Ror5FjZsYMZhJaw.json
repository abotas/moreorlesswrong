    "explanation": "No evidence that 'Will_Davison' (with underscore) is a known figure in the EA/rationalist community \u2014 appears to be unknown in EA circles. The plain name 'Will Davison' is shared by a moderately well-known Australian racecar driver, but there is no indication that an author or EA thinker by this handle has notable global prominence; at best a minor online presence if it\u2019s an individual pseudonym."
