    "explanation": "This post advances a concise, concretely framed hypothesis (Moral Power Laws) that is directly relevant to core longtermist and AI\u2011alignment debates: it changes how one thinks about value\u2011lock in, coordination, value\u2011shaping, and which interventions preserve or capture \u2018\u2018the important tail\u2019\u2019 of possible futures. If true, it would substantially alter expected\u2011value calculations and strategic priorities in EA (hence fairly high importance). However, the claim is speculative and contingent on contested metaethical and empirical premises (e.g. how much value is concentrated in exotic configurations, whether trade/coordination can allocate stars, or whether values converge), so it is not foundational in the sense of overturning the whole field \u2014 it\u2019s an influential framing and decision\u2011relevant hypothesis rather than a settled, load\u2011bearing theorem. For general humanity the implications are large in principle but abstract and distant; the post is unlikely to immediately affect broad public policy or behavior, so its practical importance is moderate\u2011low."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Be explicit and rigorous about what you mean by a \u201cpower law\u201d and how you measure value across state-space. Right now the core claim (MPL) is intuitive but underspecified: is the distribution over states, over resource-equivalent instantiations, over observer-moments, or over some other measure? Different choices of measure (per-joule, per-computation, per-mind, per-variant) produce very different tails. Actionable fixes: add a short formal model (variables, measure, and a parametric family of distributions), show how the fraction of value captured depends on those modelling choices, and run 2\u20133 toy calculations with plausible parameter ranges. That will turn a handwave into an argument you and readers can test/argue about instead of quibbling over definitions. \n\n2) Address major selection/convergence mechanisms that undermine the \u201cwe won\u2019t value the important things\u201d claim. The post treats divergence of preferences and moral fragility as likely defaults but underweights reasons future actors might (a) converge on certain high-value targets (via reasoning, institutional design, epistemic processes), (b) have strong instrumental incentives to pursue resource-allocation patterns that incidentally capture extreme-value states, or (c) be subject to selection/anthropic effects that bias the observed distribution of valuers. Actionable fixes: add a focused section evaluating each mechanism (epistemic convergence, institutional bargaining/trade, instrumental convergence for resources, anthropic/selection effects), estimate how plausible each is and how strongly it would blunt the MPL conclusion, and discuss what empirical or theoretical evidence would move you towards/away from those mechanisms. \n\n3) Explicitly engage the strongest ethical and physical countermodels that would reduce tail-heaviness. You mention a few (diminishing returns, average utilitarianism, incommensurability) but keep them brief. Important missing pieces: (a) how plausible are axiologies that cap marginal value (and would they still make longtermism compelling?), (b) how physical constraints (efficiency limits, error-correcting/maintenance costs, coordination frictions) shrink realizable differences between competing instantiations, and (c) whether plausible decision-aggregation institutions (markets, bargaining, reserve allocation like MacAskill\u2019s story) provide robust lower bounds on captured value. Actionable fixes: for each countermodel give a one-paragraph assessment of how it changes the main numeric/qualitative conclusion and, where possible, indicate how robust your MPL conclusion is to adopting that model (e.g., \u201cif marginal utility falls as X^-alpha with alpha>Y, MPL no longer implies <10^-20 capture\u201d).\n\nOverall: tighten the model/measure, test sensitivity to reasonable alternatives, and explicitly weigh concrete convergence/selection arguments. Those steps will prevent the strongest and most obvious knockdowns (semantics, measure choice, and convergence/instrumental counterarguments) from undermining the piece when readers push back.",
    "improvement_potential": "Targets major, substantive gaps: the post\u2019s core claim is underspecified (what measure is the power law over?), it underweights plausible convergence/selection/instrumental mechanisms that could defeat the MPL conclusion, and it skims important countermodels (axiologies, physical limits, institutions). Addressing these would materially strengthen or refute the thesis without being nitpicky; the recommendations are actionable and would prevent obvious pushback, so they\u2019re critical but not showstoppers."

    "post_id": "Kmdg8hnt5whQzfmzK",
    "clarity_score": 7,
    "explanation": "Strengths: The post states a clear central hypothesis (Moral Power Laws), is well structured (summary, intuition pumps, formalisation, objections, responses, lower bound) and uses concrete examples and footnotes to support claims. Weaknesses: It is long and occasionally jargon-heavy, with some large inferential leaps and informal reasoning that would benefit from a tighter formalisation or clearer definitions (e.g. what exactly is being measured on the x/y axes, precise notion of 'value'). As written it is accessible to the EA/philosophy audience but requires effort from less technical readers and could be more concise in places."

    "novelty_humanity": 8,
    "explanation": "For an EA/longtermist audience the post mostly recombines familiar themes \u2014 value fragility, tail-dominance (e.g. Bostrom/Shulman on astronomical waste), hedonium vs human preferences, value lock\u2011in and trade-based mitigations \u2014 into a readable formal framing as a 'Moral Power Law'. That framing is a useful articulation but not a highly original conceptual leap for that readership. For the general educated public, however, the core claim (that moral value across possible futures is power\u2011law distributed and that tiny mismatches could wipe out nearly all value) is fairly novel and provocative: most people haven\u2019t thought about value distributions over vast future option spaces, the technical tail risks, or the implication that tiny fractions of preference alignment could determine nearly all moral value."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post is clear, well-structured and engages relevant counterarguments (metaethics, alternative ethical views) rather than asserting the claim dogmatically. It gives several plausible intuition pumps (hedonium, substrate efficiency, value fragility/lexicality) and identifies mechanisms (option-space expansion, lack of convergence, failure of aggregation) that could produce a huge mismatch between what matters and what people actually value. \n\nWeaknesses: The core claim is highly speculative and under-specified (what exactly is being measured as \u201cvalue\u201d, how x-axis weighting is defined). There is almost no empirical evidence or formal model supporting a power-law fit for moral value across state-space \u2014 arguments are mostly conceptual and hypothetical. Several key inferences (e.g., that future option-space will make moral value dramatically more heavy-tailed, or that most agents won\u2019t converge on the high-value edge cases) depend on controversial, under-argued assumptions about metaethics, future technologies, and preference stability. The post correctly raises objections but does not resolve the big empirical and definitional gaps; as a result the thesis is plausible as a cautionary, conceptual hypothesis but weakly supported as a predictive claim."

([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3386878/?utm_source=openai)) Bostrom and related writers do provide calculations showing astronomically larger computational capacity for engineered 'computronium' or star-scale computation vs. brains (orders of magnitude differences are commonly cited), but the precise factors (e.g. \u201c10^20\u00d7\u201d) are model-dependent and sensitive to assumptions. ([fhi.ox.ac.uk](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/bostrom-n-%C2%93astronomical-waste-the-opportunity-cost-of-delayed-technological-development%C2%94-utilitas-vol-15-no-3-2003-pp-308-314/?utm_source=openai), [openphilanthropy.org](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/brain-computation-report?utm_source=openai)) Empirical methods for identifying true power laws are nontrivial and require careful statistical testing \u2014 many apparent \u201cpower laws\u201d fail such tests \u2014 so the central empirical claim (that moral value across possible states is a power law) is not established by data and would be hard to test. ([researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/1893485_Power-Law_Distributions_in_Empirical_Data?utm_source=openai)) The post\u2019s intuition that nonhuman life could dominate any simple count or resource metric is consistent with biomass estimates showing humans are a tiny fraction of global biomass while arthropods/marine life dominate; this supports the plausibility of the author\u2019s point that valuing nonhuman creatures could swamp human-centered value by sheer scale \u2014 but converting biomass counts into moral value is a normative step, not an empirical one. ([pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1711842115?utm_source=openai)) Overall: the numerical and scientific building blocks the author cites are mostly accurate in spirit, but the core thesis (Moral Power Laws) is a speculative, test-challenging extrapolation rather than an empirically demonstrated fact.",
