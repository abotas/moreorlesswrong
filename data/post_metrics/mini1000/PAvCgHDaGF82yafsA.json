    "explanation": "This is a clear, accessible, and practically important reminder that adding controls in a regression is not a magic fix for causal inference \u2014 a point that is well-known among causal-statistics experts but routinely ignored in practice. For the EA/rationalist community this is fairly high\u2011value: many policy, prioritization, and safety decisions depend on correctly distinguishing correlation from causation, so misreading 'controls' can lead to systematically wrong conclusions and wasted resources. For general humanity it\u2019s moderately important: the article helps explain why much health and social science reporting is overconfident, and better public understanding would reduce bad decisions, but the core ideas are not novel or revolutionary and don\u2019t by themselves change empirical facts or settle most specific debates."

    "robustness_score": 3,
    "actionable_feedback": "1) Overbroad claim without the key positive condition: The post argues that \u201ccontrolling\u201d usually fails but doesn\u2019t clearly state the well\u2011known, formal condition under which conditioning does give unbiased causal estimates (the backdoor criterion / appropriate adjustment set in causal DAG language). Readers familiar with causal inference will see this as a major omission. Actionable fix: add a short paragraph explaining when controlling works (e.g., if you condition on a valid backdoor set and avoid conditioning on colliders/mediators), give a simple DAG example that satisfies the backdoor criterion, and cite canonical resources (Pearl, Hern\u00e1n & Robins, Imbens & Rubin) so readers know the exception to your rule.    \n\n2) Tone and straw\u2011manning of observational research weakens credibility: The post lumps together all observational work as naive and accuses authors of semantic games. That risks alienating informed readers and overlooks high\u2011quality observational methods (natural experiments, IVs, DiD, RDD, longitudinal designs, negative controls, sensitivity analysis). Actionable fix: temper the rhetoric, make clear you\u2019re targeting a common bad practice (throwing variables into regressions without causal thinking), and call out exemplary practices or papers that do observational causal inference properly. This will make the critique sharper and more persuasive.    \n\n3) Lacks practical alternatives/checklist for researchers who can\u2019t run RCTs: The post criticizes controlling but gives only cursory pointers (IVs, natural experiments). Many readers will find the post less useful unless it suggests concrete, feasible practices. Actionable fix: add a concise, high\u2011value checklist (~5 items) for observational researchers (e.g., draw DAGs and pre\u2011specify adjustment sets; avoid conditioning on colliders/mediators; use negative controls and sensitivity/robustness analyses such as E\u2011values; exploit natural experiments/IVs/longitudinal methods where possible; transparently report assumptions). Include 2\u20133 short references or toolkits so readers can follow up.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback pinpointed three substantive, actionable gaps: (1) omission of the well\u2011known formal exception (backdoor/valid adjustment sets), (2) need to temper accusatory tone and acknowledge good observational practice, and (3) lack of a concise practical checklist for researchers \u2014 addressing these would substantially increase the post's accuracy and persuasiveness without requiring a large expansion."

    "clarity_score": 9,
    "explanation": "Very clear and well-structured: intuitive opening analogy, concrete toy data and regressions, numbered failure modes, and real-world examples make the argument easy to follow and persuasive. The informal tone helps accessibility. Minor weaknesses: it's a bit long, assumes some basic statistical literacy (so a few readers might want a concise summary of technical terms like 'collider' or 'mediation'), and could include an explicit short takeaways section. Overall highly readable and compelling."

    "explanation": "Most of the post\u2019s claims are standard points from causal-inference literature (confounding, reverse causality, collider/overcontrol bias, measurement error, model misspecification) and are familiar to researchers and many EA readers. The piece is a clear, well-written popular summary and uses accessible examples/metaphors (cathedral) but offers little that\u2019s technically new. For a general educated audience the concrete examples and blunt framing make several nuances less commonly appreciated, so it\u2019s moderately novel there."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post uses clear, well-structured causal examples and diagrams to show key failure modes of 'controlling' in regressions (reverse causation, confounding, mediators, feedback, measurement error). The arguments are intuitive, logically coherent, and highlight many standard pitfalls that statisticians and causal-inference researchers emphasize. Weaknesses: The piece is largely illustrative and rhetorical rather than empirical \u2014 it gives toy datasets and qualitative examples rather than systematic evidence about how often real-world controls mislead. It also sometimes overstates with broad language (e.g. 'doesn't (usually) work') without quantifying domains where controls are valid, and it doesn't explicitly situate the critique in formal causal-inference terminology (back-door criterion, collider bias) or cite the relevant literature in depth. Overall, the post provides strong conceptual support for being skeptical of naive controls, but less strong empirical proof that this failure is the typical outcome across applied research."

    "validation_notes": "Overall assessment: The post\u2019s central empirical claims are well-supported by mainstream causal-inference and epidemiology literature. Key accurate points: (1) \u201cControlling for a variable\u201d in practice usually means conditioning/including a covariate in a regression; (2) doing so only yields valid causal estimates under substantive (often untestable) assumptions about causal directions and absence of unmeasured confounding (the back-door / do-calculus logic); (3) controlling can hurt (overadjustment) when you adjust for mediators or colliders and can induce bias or sign-reversal (Simpson\u2019s paradox/omitted-variable bias); (4) measurement error / noisy controls attenuate or otherwise bias estimates; (5) RCTs (interventions) avoid many of these problems. These claims are documented in the causal-inference literature (Pearl; Hern\u00e1n & Robins) and epidemiologic method papers (Schisterman et al.; Cole et al.; STRATOS/NIH guidance). Where the post is slightly overstated: its headline (\u201cdoesn\u2019t (usually) work\u201d) is polemical \u2014 controlling/adjustment can and does produce valid causal inferences when the researcher has an appropriate causal model, measures the right covariates well, and the backdoor criterion (or other identification strategy) is satisfied. In short: the post correctly lists the major failure modes and is consistent with authoritative sources; but its rhetorical absolutism understates that valid adjustment is possible with correct assumptions and data.",
