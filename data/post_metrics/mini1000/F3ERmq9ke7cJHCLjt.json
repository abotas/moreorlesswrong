    "explanation": "This is essentially an event/invitation to a prompt-design challenge about using AI for the SDGs. It may spur useful ideas, community engagement, and small-scale experimentation, but it contains no novel, foundational arguments or evidence. If true/false it would have negligible effect on major EA or global decisions \u2014 at best modest practical value for idea generation and outreach."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Missing clear goal and judging criteria. The post doesn\u2019t define what \u201cbest use\u201d means or how submissions will be evaluated. Add a one\u2011line mission (e.g., generate deployable interventions for SDG targets, produce policy briefs, or create educational materials), a concise judging rubric (impact potential, feasibility, accuracy, novelty, equity), and an explicit submission format and deadline. Include 2\u20133 example prompts and an ideal model output so entrants know the standard.  \n\n2) No details on scope, audience, or safeguards. Specify which SDGs or targets are in scope, who you\u2019re inviting (researchers, practitioners, students), and any constraints (language, model type, proprietary data). Call out how you\u2019ll handle hallucinations, biased or harmful suggestions, and data/privacy/IP for participant submissions. A short moderation/ethics checklist will reduce low\u2011quality or risky entries.  \n\n3) Weak follow\u2011through and incentives. Say what will happen to winning prompts (publication, funding, piloting), how winners are chosen, and what participants gain (feedback, visibility, prizes). If the aim is impact, describe a realistic next step (partner organizations, metrics for deployment, timeline). Without this, motivation and credibility will be low.",
    "improvement_potential": "Identifies clear, actionable omissions that are major for a challenge post: no success criteria/judging rubric, undefined scope/audience and missing safety/ethics safeguards, and lack of follow\u2011through or incentives. Fixing these would substantially raise participation quality and reduce reputational/risk hazards; doing so needn't overly lengthen the post. Not catastrophic (the event can still run), but these are critical improvements the author should implement."

    "post_id": "F3ERmq9ke7cJHCLjt",
    "clarity_score": 5,
    "explanation": "The post is very short and easy to parse \u2014 it's an invitation to a prompt challenge about using AI for the SDGs with links to the challenge and rules. However it provides almost no context or details (no summary of goals, target SDGs, deadlines, how to participate, or why EA readers should care). That makes the intent and value proposition unclear and forces readers to follow links to understand the event. Concise but too terse to be compelling."

    "novelty_humanity": 3,
    "explanation": "This is essentially an announcement of a prompt-design contest around using AI to advance the SDGs. The core idea \u2014 applying AI to SDGs and crowdsourcing ideas via challenges \u2014 is already widely discussed among EAs and in broader tech/policy communities, so it has low novelty. The only slightly less common element is framing it specifically as a 'prompt challenge' (prompt-engineering crowdsourcing), but that alone doesn't make the concept highly original."

    "overall_support": 2,
    "explanation": "The post is essentially an announcement/invitation (a prompt challenge) rather than an argued position. It poses the question 'How to best use AI to reach SDG?' but provides no structured argument, causal reasoning, mechanisms, or counterarguments. It also supplies no empirical evidence, metrics, case studies, or citations to support any claims. Strengths: it creates a constructive forum for soliciting ideas and participation. Weaknesses: lacks thesis development, logical structure, and supporting data, so it provides very little substantive support for conclusions about using AI to achieve SDGs."
