    "explanation": "This post is an accessible philosophical reflection and promo for Chappell\u2019s views (defense of utilitarian/telic framing and critique of deontology). If correct, it modestly informs moral framing within EA and rationalist circles (how to think about what we should prefer and how to structure norms), but it is not a rigorous, novel argument that would overturn core EA positions or policy choices. For the general public it\u2019s largely niche/philosophical and has little direct practical impact."

    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "Well-structured and readable: the Q&A format, headings, and concrete examples (novel excerpt) make the main contrast between agent-neutral consequentialism and agent-relative deontology easy to follow. Minor weaknesses: a few technical terms (telic/deontic, naive instrumentalism, \"curse of deontology\") are used without full unpacking, some passages are dense and assume philosophical background, and the argumentative claims are sketched rather than fully defended. Overall clear and engaging for an audience with some philosophical familiarity, slightly less accessible to general readers."

    "explanation": "Most of the post rehashes well-worn debates (consequentialism vs deontology, agent\u2011neutral vs agent\u2011relative reasons, the trolley intuitions). EA Forum readers will find these moves very familiar; the distinctive bits are framing choices \u2014 e.g. calling the problem \u201cthe curse of deontology,\u201d the emphasis on decomposing deontic into telic + decision\u2011theoretic components, and the critique of \u201cnaive instrumentalism\u201d \u2014 but those are more reframings than truly new arguments. For a general educated audience the telic/deontic decomposition and the critique of instrumental rationality are somewhat less familiar, so the post has modest novelty there, but the core claims (we should prefer better outcomes; consequentialism vs deontology tradeoffs) are widely circulated in popular philosophy."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post raises a clear, interesting conceptual point (the so-called \"curse of deontology\") and highlights an important distinction between telic (what outcomes we should prefer) and deontic (what agents ought to do) judgments. The two-stage method (decide which outcomes to prefer, then design norms to achieve them) is lucid and maps onto familiar consequentialist strategy. Weaknesses: The argument is largely conceptual and informal, rests on contested premises (e.g. that deontological views must endorse agent-relative optimism about others' behavior or that deontic and telic claims are cleanly separable), and does not engage seriously with standard deontological replies or the extensive literature that complicates the simple agent-relative vs agent-neutral dichotomy. Empirical claims (about human fallibility, biases, or the practical superiority of utilitarian-derived norms) are asserted without supporting data. Overall, an interesting and partly persuasive philosophical sketch, but under-supported and under-defended for a strong endorsement."

    "validation_notes": "Most of the post\u2019s claims are conceptual/philosophical and accurately reflect accepted distinctions and Chappell\u2019s published views (e.g. agent\u2011relative vs agent\u2011neutral reasons; his \u2018telic vs decision\u2011theoretic\u2019 framing; his \u2018curse of deontology\u2019/\u2018preference and prevention\u2019 argument). These conceptual claims are well supported by the philosophical literature and by Chappell\u2019s own publications. However, one empirical overstatement is present: the claim that \u201cmost philosophers think that utilitarianism is a deeply \u2018counterintuitive\u2019 view, and that common sense better supports some form of deontology\u201d is not supported by representative surveys of professional philosophers (the profession is divided and no clear majority endorses deontology over consequentialism). Empirical moral\u2011psychology results about ordinary intuitions (e.g. trolley dilemmas) do show strong deontological\u2011type responses in many experimental setups, but that finding concerns lay intuitions and psychological processes, not the distribution of professional philosophers\u2019 normative commitments. In short: the post\u2019s philosophical claims are well supported; the empirical claim about what most philosophers think is contradicted by survey evidence and therefore overstates the case.",

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Clarify and substantiate the central claim about 'the curse of deontology' \u2014 as written you treat agent-relativity as a single, unified deontological view that implies bystanders should prefer others to act wrongly. Many deontological positions (rights-based views, Kantian formulations, threshold deontology, etc.) do not straightforwardly yield that implication, and some deontologists explicitly adopt agent-relative duties alongside agent-neutral reasons. Actionable fix: add a short, concrete toy example that shows the alleged dilemma, then cite a couple of representative deontological sources and explain why those views fail (or don't) to avoid the dilemma. That will prevent the post from looking like a caricature of deontology. \n\n2) Don't rely on the 'naive instrumentalism' strawman without engaging stronger versions of the opposing view. You dismiss mainstream objections as targeting a caricature (agents who use obviously unreliable instrumental heuristics), but many deontologists and critics offer substantive decision-theoretic and moral-psychological defenses (e.g., rule-consequentialist accounts, arguments about moral reliability, integrity, moral luck, or the costs of expecting people to perform high-risk tradeoffs). Actionable fix: identify 1\u20132 of the strongest, specific counterarguments (e.g., the integrity objection, the moral uncertainty literature, or rule-consequentialism) and either show why your telic/deontic decomposition answers them or acknowledge remaining tensions. \n\n3) Back up bold meta-philosophical and empirical claims (e.g., 'most philosophers think X' or 'vibes are no substitute...') with references or tighten the language. The piece currently makes sweeping claims about what the mainstream believes and about human fallibility that readers in EA/philosophy will want sourced or hedged. Actionable fix: add one or two citations (survey data, prominent critics, or empirical work on moral heuristics) or rephrase to be less absolute (e.g., 'many commentators argue...', 'I take the following empirical assumptions about bias and fallibility...').\n\nMaking these three changes will reduce the appearance of straw-manning, increase credibility with philosophically sophisticated readers, and keep the piece short while substantially strengthening its argumentative core.",
    "improvement_potential": "Strong, targeted critiques of the post's biggest weaknesses: caricaturing deontology, relying on a strawman of instrumental reasoning, and making sweeping unsourced claims. Addressing these will substantially improve credibility with philosophically literate readers without requiring a long rewrite\u2014add a short toy example, cite or hedge against representative deontological views and key opposing arguments (integrity, rule-consequentialism, moral uncertainty), and supply one or two references or softer wording. These changes correct major argumentative vulnerabilities the author would likely be embarrassed about if pointed out."
