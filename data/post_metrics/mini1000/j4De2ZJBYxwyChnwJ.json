    "explanation": "This post critiques a core EA method (heavy reliance on measurable, short\u2011term metrics) and argues for reallocating some attention/resources toward hard\u2011to\u2011measure, systemic work. For the EA/rationalist community this is high\u2011impact: if the critique is right it would change funding portfolios, career priorities, and evaluation frameworks, so it is load\u2011bearing for strategic choices (though the idea is not entirely novel). For general humanity the effect is more indirect \u2014 it could alter philanthropy and policy over time if adopted, but it is not foundational to most societal decisions and therefore has moderate importance."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Overstates the problem / treats EA as monolithic. The post argues as if the EA community uniformly prioritizes only highly measurable interventions. That\u2019s a strong empirical claim you don\u2019t support and it\u2019s easy for readers to rebut with counterexamples (Open Phil, GiveWell Incubation/Discretionary grants, policy/advocacy funding, longtermist grants, EA Funds, etc.). Actionable fix: tighten the claim to a specific sub-community, funder type, or decision process you believe is biased (e.g. donor-advised grants focused on short-term cost-effectiveness), or add citations/data showing the extent of the bias you\u2019re attacking. Acknowledge existing work on systems change and high-risk funding so readers don\u2019t dismiss the piece as a strawman. \n\n2) Lacks evidence that the bias actually causes large forgone opportunities and lacks concrete examples. The bednet vs. health-system example is intuitively appealing but currently speculative. Readers will reasonably ask: where has measurement-driven conservatism demonstrably missed an intervention that would have been better? Actionable fix: add 1\u20132 concrete case studies or counterfactual analyses (historical or hypothetical) showing plausible scenarios where systemic work likely had superior expected value, or run a simple EV-style back-of-envelope comparing ranges of outcomes, probabilities, and time horizons. If you can\u2019t produce such cases, reframe the argument as a plausible risk of forgone opportunities rather than an established fact. Also briefly address harms from being less measurable (wasted funds, capture by charismatic actors). \n\n3) Proposed solutions are too high-level and contain arbitrary choices (the 70/30 split) without governance or evaluation design. Readers will want to know: how do you define \"high-risk, high-reward\"? How will we allocate, monitor, and learn from failures? How do we avoid privilege/selection biases and political harms when funding systemic work? Actionable fix: replace or supplement the 70/30 suggestion with a concrete, implementable design: e.g. criteria for labeling a grant as \"high-risk,\" size and stage-gating of pilot grants, pre-registered stopping rules, independent reviews, a learning agenda (what evidence would make you scale vs. stop), and simple portfolio-management rules (diversification, risk budget, time horizons). Even a short checklist (definition, eligibility, monitoring, stopping conditions, accountability) would materially strengthen the proposal.\n\nAddressing these three issues will make the post much harder to dismiss as rhetorical and give readers concrete next steps they can discuss or implement.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback identifies major, plausibly embarrassing flaws: treating EA as monolithic, making a strong empirical claim without evidence, and offering an arbitrary-sounding prescription (70/30) with no governance or monitoring design. Each point is actionable and would materially strengthen the post without requiring large expansions (tighten scope/cite counterexamples, add 1\u20132 concrete case studies or reframe as a risk, and replace the split with concrete criteria and stopping rules). It loses a couple of points because it doesn't prioritize which fix is most urgent or supply any concrete counterexamples itself, but overall it addresses the key weaknesses that would make readers dismiss the piece as a strawman or unserious."

    "explanation": "The post is well-structured and easy to follow: a clear central claim, a concrete analogy (bednet vs health system), anticipated objections, and concrete next steps. The core argument \u2014 that measurability can bias EA toward short, legible interventions \u2014 is presented compellingly, but it leans more on intuition than on concrete evidence or detailed counterexamples, which weakens argumentative force. The piece is largely concise and readable, though a few sections repeat the same point and the suggested solutions remain high-level rather than operational. Overall, very clear and engaging but could be tightened and strengthened with more evidence and specifics."

    "explanation": "Most of the post\u2019s claims are familiar: the \u2018measurability bias\u2019/streetlight effect in philanthropy, bednets-versus-systems tradeoffs, and calls for portfolio allocation and better qualitative evaluation have all been widely discussed in EA circles and in broader philanthropy. The post is a clear, well-framed articulation of these critiques but offers few genuinely new concepts \u2014 the closest-to-novel elements are the specific EA-targeted framing and reiterating a formal split between measurable vs high-risk/high-reward funding, which are already common proposals among funders."

    "explanation": "The post is logically coherent and well-structured: it identifies a plausible measurement bias (favoring short, legible interventions like bednets), lays out clear objections, and proposes reasonable mitigations (portfolio approach, better tools). However, the argument is largely conceptual and anecdotal rather than empirical. It provides no data or case studies showing EA systematically underinvests in superior hard-to-measure systemic interventions, nor evidence that such interventions reliably outperform measurable ones. Important trade-offs and failure modes (e.g., political complexity, long time horizons, downside risks, opportunity costs) are acknowledged but not analyzed in depth. Overall, the thesis is plausible and worth discussion, but weakly supported by evidence and incomplete in its treatment of practical risks and empirical magnitude."

    "validation_notes": "Most of the post\u2019s empirical claims are well-supported: (a) EA\u2019s culture emphasizes evidence, cost\u2011effectiveness, and measurable outcomes (MacAskill/GiveWell), (b) insecticide\u2011treated bednets (ITNs/LLINs) are a highly cost\u2011effective, well\u2011measured intervention (GiveWell; Bhatt et al. Nature 2015; WHO), and (c) system\u2011level health strengthening is complex and harder to evaluate (WHO, MRC, peer\u2011reviewed reviews). Scholarly and popular critiques (e.g. The Tyranny of Metrics) and GiveWell\u2019s own writeups also document limitations of raw expected\u2011value calculations and risks of \u201cmetric fixation.\u201d However, the stronger empirical claim \u2014 that EA \u201cwill almost always favor\u201d measurable options to the systematic exclusion of systemic/high\u2011risk opportunities \u2014 is partly overstated: EA funders (e.g., Open Philanthropy, Long\u2011Term Future/longshot programs) explicitly fund high\u2011risk/high\u2011reward and systems/advocacy work alongside direct measurable programs. There is good conceptual and documented evidence of measurement bias and its dangers, but direct empirical proof that EA as a whole has routinely missed superior systemic opportunities (i.e., concrete counterfactual examples) is limited, making that part more speculative. Overall: major factual premises are supported; some normative/causal claims about community\u2011level neglect are plausible but not conclusively proven.",
