    "explanation": "This is an important corrective for the EA community: it points to systematic epistemic and demographic biases (overreliance on economics, underuse of other social sciences, and inherited homogeneity) that can skew cause selection, policy recommendations, research methods, and recruitment. If true, it meaningfully affects EA decision quality, inclusiveness, and credibility (so it is load-bearing for many internal choices), but it is not a foundational existential claim. For general humanity the direct stakes are smaller \u2014 the post highlights real problems whose wider correction could improve policy and research, but its impact outside EA is limited unless EA\u2019s influence on public policy grows substantially."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Conflates correlation with causation \u2014 you argue EA \u201cinherits\u201d problems from economics but offer little evidence that economics being overrepresented causes bad EA outcomes. Actionable fix: either tone this as a hypothesis or add concrete causal evidence. For example, show instances where EA decisions relied on oversimplified economic models and produced demonstrable harms or opportunity costs; or run a small content analysis / survey showing that economics-heavy posts correlate with specific mistaken policy recommendations. If you can\u2019t add causal evidence, explicitly reframe claims as correlations and hypothesized mechanisms.\n\n2) Overgeneralises and cherry-picks literature/examples \u2014 some claims (economists believe interdisciplinary work is worse; example of minimum-wage economics) are presented without nuance and risk alienating readers who value economics\u2019 methods. Actionable fix: acknowledge counterarguments and benefits of economic methods, update stats and citations (you note they\u2019re out of date), and contextualise Fourcade/Angrist findings (e.g. doctoring the interpretation: they show citation patterns and attitudes in certain samples, not universal behavior). Replace sweeping language with calibrated claims and one-sentence caveats that prevent easy rebuttals.\n\n3) Lacks concrete, implementable recommendations \u2014 the post calls for more diversity of disciplines but doesn\u2019t say how EA should practically do that. Actionable fix: add 2\u20134 specific, low-effort interventions (e.g. add forum tags for sociology/anthropology and run a curated weekly reading list; launch a visiting-scholar / speaker series; include social-science representation as a hiring/review criterion for orgs; run a small trial fellowship for non-economist social scientists) and a simple way to measure impact (e.g. counts of posts/tags, survey of perceived disciplinary balance). This keeps the post constructive and increases likelihood it will spur change.",
    "improvement_potential": "Targets three major weaknesses: an implied causal claim (EA \u201cinherits\u201d problems) that the author can\u2019t currently support, overgeneralisation/cherry\u2011picking that invites easy rebuttal, and lack of concrete, low\u2011cost recommendations. Fixing these would materially strengthen credibility and impact without requiring a long rewrite, and it also points out 'own goals' (making causal claims and sweeping statements) the author would likely want to avoid."

    "explanation": "Overall clear and well-structured: the post states a single claim, gives multiple concrete lines of evidence (forum tags, citation studies, empirical examples, demographics) and ties them to consequences for EA. Strengths include accessible writing, useful links/figures, and a logical flow (problem \u2192 evidence \u2192 consequence \u2192 short recommendation). Weaknesses: occasional repetition and visual/link clutter, a few causal leaps (e.g. from economist prevalence to specific EA failures) that could use tighter argumentation, and a brief, underdeveloped conclusion/suggestions section.

    "explanation": "Among EA-readers the core claims (EA\u2019s disciplinary skew toward economics/philosophy/CS, and the resulting demographic and methodological blind spots) are already familiar, so the piece is only mildly novel \u2014 its main new contribution is stitching together specific citation\u2011pattern and demographic evidence about economics and directly linking those structural features to EA recruitment. For a general educated audience the specific application to the EA community and the synthesis of econ\u2019s documented insularity (Fourcade/Angrist, etc.) with concrete EA demographic data is moderately novel: the empirical citations and explicit argument that EA 'inherits' economics\u2019 problems make the post less obvious to non\u2011specialists."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post makes a clear, plausible argument and cites reputable empirical work (Fourcade et al., Angrist et al., Card et al., EA survey, Bayer & Rouse, AEA survey) to support claims about economics' insularity, citation dominance, and demographic homogeneity. The minimum-wage example usefully illustrates how simple economic models can mislead. Weaknesses: The argument sometimes leaps from correlation to causation (i.e., from EA having many economists to inheriting specific disciplinary problems) without direct evidence tying economics dominance to concrete negative EA outcomes. Some claims are broad or under-evidenced (e.g., that EA\u2019s policy mistakes are driven by economics overreliance), there is limited engagement with counterevidence or alternative explanations, and some referenced numbers are acknowledged as out of date. Overall the thesis is plausible and moderately well supported but would benefit from more direct causal evidence and systematic analysis of impacts within EA."

    "validation_notes": "Most of the post's central empirical claims are supported by reliable sources, but a few important claims are oversimplified or slightly misleading. Evidence that economics is overrepresented / relatively insular in the social-science ecosystem is well documented (Fourcade et al. 2015) and Angrist et al. (2020) documents citation patterns and a recent rise in economics\u2019 extramural influence (so the post\u2019s claim that Angrist \u201cconfirmed\u201d persistent insularity is a partial/nuanced fit rather than a straightforward confirmation). The post correctly reports EA demographics from the EA Survey 2022 (\u224829% women, \u224876% white). The literature on minimum wages is contested: classic studies (Card & Krueger, Dube/Allegretto) find small or no disemployment effects in many settings, while other work and meta-analyses (Neumark & Wascher and others) find negative effects \u2014 so the post\u2019s unqualified statement that \u201cempirical evidence \u2026 shows it doesn't [increase unemployment]\u201d is an overstatement. Claims about underrepresentation and discrimination in economics (Bayer & Rouse; AEA climate survey) and underrepresentation in related fields (computer science, philosophy) are well supported. Overall: majority of major empirical claims are backed by reputable sources, but the post glosses over important nuances and the heterogeneity of evidence on some topics (notably minimum-wage effects and the evolving citation patterns between disciplines).",
