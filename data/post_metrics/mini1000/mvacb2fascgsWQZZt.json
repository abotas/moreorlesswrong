    "explanation": "This is a useful, actionable, data-driven pilot report that matters for EA/global-health donors and program designers: it provides empirical evidence that addressing supply shortages raises contraceptive uptake substantially and gives cost\u2011effectiveness estimates using GiveWell\u2019s framework. If true and scalable, it could redirect funding and inform policy in Nigeria, saving lives at modest cost. It is not foundational for EA worldviews or high\u2011level priorities (e.g., AI safety/longtermism), and its broader global impact depends on replication, durability of effects, and assumptions in the modelling, so its importance is moderate rather than critical."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Unclear causal identification and risk of bias in the pilot impact estimates \u2014 clarify whether treatment allocation was randomized, how control facilities were selected, and report basic statistical inference. Actionable fixes: state the randomization/allocation procedure (or why not randomized), show sample sizes per arm, pre/post periods used, and report effect sizes with confidence intervals and p-values. Add robustness checks: balance tests on baseline characteristics, results excluding facilities affected by major staffing/outreach events, and an analysis that adjusts for the documented USAID disruptions (or at least a sensitivity that drops affected facilities). Without this, readers will suspect selection bias or regression-to-the-mean as alternative explanations for the big percentage changes (especially the 90% implant figure).\n\n2) Cost\u2011effectiveness extrapolation rests on opaque, highly sensitive assumptions \u2014 make the causal chain from additional commodities -> CYP -> pregnancies averted -> lives saved explicit and present uncertainty. Actionable fixes: in the post (and linked spreadsheet) list the key parameters used (baseline contraceptive prevalence, method-specific continuation/substitution rates, how CYP maps to pregnancies averted, maternal mortality rate used, and any assumptions about service quality or leakage). Provide a one\u2011page sensitivity analysis or tornado chart showing how your $2,400 and $6,600/life estimates change under plausible alternative assumptions (e.g., 0%, 25%, 50% leakage/theft; lower continuation; different MMR). If you can\u2019t include a full sensitivity analysis in the post, at minimum summarise the top 3 most influential assumptions and why you chose the central estimate.\n\n3) Scalability and policy claims under\u2011argued (crowding out, sustainability, political risk, and the urgency framing). Actionable fixes: temper definitive language about guaranteed policy wins and state budget lines unless you can cite signed MOUs or commitments \u2014 instead describe the strength of commitments (e.g., verbal buy\u2011in vs. signed agreement) and remaining political/financial barriers. Discuss risks to scaling: donor crowding\u2011out (how will donations affect the state\u2019s willingness to fund procurement later?), theft/diversion at larger scale and how your mitigation will handle it, and fiscal constraints on state health budgets. If you assert a time\u2011sensitive $50k June deadline, explain why that specific threshold and timing are binding (e.g., exact dates for budget committee submissions, documented timelines from officials), or remove the ultimatum to avoid appearing arbitrary.",
    "improvement_potential": "Highly relevant and actionable. The three points identify major credibility risks (causal identification, opaque CE assumptions, and overconfident scaling/policy claims) that could seriously undermine the post\u2019s conclusions if left unaddressed. Implementing the recommended clarifications, basic inferential statistics, and a concise sensitivity summary would materially improve trustworthiness without requiring excessive extra length; the advice on tempering urgent claims is also important to avoid an embarrassing \u2018own goal.\u2019"

    "explanation": "Well-structured and easy to follow: clear TL;DR, distinct sections (Problem, Pilot Results, Year 2, Funding), and concrete quantitative claims that make the main argument compelling. Strengths include specific metrics (percent increases, CYP, $/CYP, $/life saved), calls to action, and useful links. Weaknesses: occasional jargon and footnote formatting make some parts harder to parse quickly; key methodological choices and counterfactual/control details are summarized rather than shown, and a few figures/comparisons (e.g. long-term vs Year 2 $/life and 20x vs 55x cash-transfer claims) could use clearer explanation or reconciliation. Overall concise enough for the audience but slightly long for casual readers."

    "explanation": "Most of the post\u2019s claims and strategies are familiar to people in global health/EA: contraception as cost\u2011effective, supply\u2011chain bottlenecks limiting uptake, state procurement advocacy, and tools like mystery shoppers and data digitisation. The main new content is empirical: the pilot\u2019s specific uptake increases, CYPs delivered, and the organisation\u2019s cost\u2011effectiveness estimates using GiveWell\u2019s framework. Those results are useful evidence but not a novel conceptual idea \u2014 likewise the proposed scaling and advocacy approach are standard implementation strategies."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post identifies a plausible, important problem (stockouts), runs a real-world pilot with treatment and control groups, collects facility-level consumption/stock/delivery data, and anchors impact valuation to GiveWell's published model. Reported large percentage increases in uptake and concrete CYP and cost-per-CYP estimates are useful and suggestive. Weaknesses: Key causal-inference details are missing (was allocation randomized or otherwise quasi-experimental? how comparable were intervention and control facilities?), there is little statistical reporting (no baseline counts, CIs, p-values, or regression controls), and confounders (notably USAID supply disruptions and potential outreach events) are acknowledged but not rigorously adjusted for. Cost-effectiveness relies heavily on modelled conversions (CYP\u2192pregnancies\u2192lives) and program cost assumptions that aren\u2019t fully transparent in the post, and external validity is uncertain (two states, scale-up risks like leakage/theft and substitution not fully addressed). Overall: the reasoning is plausible and the pilot provides encouraging signals, but the empirical evidence as presented is insufficiently rigorous and transparent to give high confidence in the headline cost-effectiveness claims without further data, methodological details, and sensitivity analyses."

    "validation_notes": "Summary: Many of the high-level, country-level health claims in the post are supported by reputable sources (Nigeria\u2019s very large share of global maternal deaths and an MMR on the order of ~1,000/100,000 are consistent with WHO/MMEIG estimates and secondary reporting). Claims about high rates of contraceptive stockouts are plausible and supported by multiple facility-level studies showing common stockouts, but the specific headline figures from the pilot (e.g., \u201c80% of facilities are missing at least two types of contraceptives\u201d) and the pilot effect sizes (70% oral, 90% implants, 240% condoms, etc.), CYP gains, prevented pregnancies, lives saved, and the $/CYP and $/life-saved numbers are based on AMI\u2019s internal data and modeling and cannot be independently verified from public sources without AMI\u2019s raw facility-level data and the accessible cost-effectiveness spreadsheet. Specific notes:\n  - Supported / well-aligned with external evidence: (a) Nigeria accounts for a very large share of global maternal deaths (cited WHO-based estimates \u2014 ~28.5% of global maternal deaths in 2020), and (b) Nigeria\u2019s maternal mortality ratio has been estimated around ~1,000 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by international estimates (WHO/MMEIG / World Bank series). These two claims are accurate as stated. (sources: WHO/MMEIG reporting, Africa Check summary).  \n  - Partly supported / imprecise: The post\u2019s claim that \u201c~29% of pregnancies are unintended\u201d is close to Guttmacher\u2019s country-level estimates in some reports (Guttmacher\u2019s \u201cAdding It Up\u201d reported ~24% for 2018), so the general claim that a substantial share of pregnancies are unintended is supported, but the exact percentage varies by source and year. (source: Guttmacher).  \n  - Contradicted / implausible as-stated: The post\u2019s statement that \u201c6 out of 10 women of reproductive age have an unmet need for contraception\u201d (i.e., ~60% unmet need) is inconsistent with nationally representative estimates (DHS / UN compilations and multiple studies) which show much lower national unmet-need estimates (commonly ~14\u201319% for married women, though some subgroups or post-partum samples can show much higher unmet-need rates). This phrasing appears to be incorrect or misleading without clarification of population subgroup. (sources: NDHS-derived analyses, peer-reviewed studies).  \n  - Stockouts / supply constraints: Multiple peer-reviewed and program reports document frequent contraceptive stockouts in Nigeria and other LMIC settings; these support the general conclusion that supply is a major constraint. However, published multi-site studies show stockout rates by method typically in the tens of percent (method- and region-dependent), not necessarily the specific \u201c80% missing \u22652 types\u201d figure \u2014 that appears to be an AMI pilot-specific finding and cannot be externally corroborated without the pilot data or public breakdown. (sources: PMA/Performance Monitoring for Action Agile multicountry analysis; facility surveys).  \n  - Cost-effectiveness and lives-saved economics: GiveWell has published a \u201cvaluing contraception\u201d model and a public spreadsheet that AMI references; GiveWell\u2019s conceptual framework supports measuring contraception benefits in CYP and translating to lives/DALYs and \u201cx cash\u201d metrics. The post\u2019s claim that interventions under ~$26/CYP in Nigeria meet GiveWell\u2019s bar is consistent with AMI\u2019s citation of GiveWell regional estimates, but AMI\u2019s reported <$5/CYP long-term, $2,400/life-saved, and \u201c55x direct cash transfer\u201d rely on AMI\u2019s internal costing and the mapping to GiveWell\u2019s model \u2014 these specific numeric outputs are therefore not independently verifiable from public sources without AMI\u2019s published data & calculations. (sources: GiveWell valuing-contraception page; AMI post).  \n  - Overall judgement: the post mixes accurate, well-documented country-level facts and plausible program conclusions with pilot-specific numbers and cost-effectiveness outputs that are not independently verifiable from publicly-available sources. To increase confidence, AMI should (a) publish the pilot dataset or an anonymized aggregated results table and (b) publish the full cost-effectiveness workbook (or make the referenced Google Sheets readable), including assumptions and sensitivity analyses. Given the mix of verified national facts and unverifiable program-level claims, a mid-high score (6/10) is appropriate.",
