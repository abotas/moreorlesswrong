    "explanation": "This is an operational announcement soliciting user feedback for Forum strategy. It could modestly affect how the EA Forum is run (features, moderation, priorities) and therefore influence community discourse and CEA resource allocation, but it isn't foundational to EA theory or major cause decisions. For the wider world it is essentially irrelevant."

    "explanation": "The post is clear, friendly, and provides the key details readers need: purpose, dates, estimated time, that questions are optional, who it\u2019s for, and why responses matter. It has a straightforward call to action and useful links/footnotes. Minor weaknesses: a few small redundancies (e.g. reiterating why responses matter), slightly cluttered footnote formatting, and the actual survey link/button isn't visible in the excerpt \u2014 tightening wording and simplifying footnotes would make it a bit more concise."

    "explanation": "This is a routine announcement for an annual user survey. The core idea \u2014 asking users to complete an optional survey to inform platform strategy \u2014 is extremely common both within the EA community and across organizations. The only mildly specific details (timing, optional questions, browser-save feature, use for Forum strategy) are procedural and not conceptually novel."

    "overall_support": 5,
    "explanation": "The post presents a straightforward, mostly logical case for running the survey (surveys inform Forum strategy; responses are read and will guide work next year; most questions are optional), and it is transparent about logistics and scope. However, it offers little empirical evidence about the survey's impact (no response rates, no concrete examples of decisions driven by prior survey results beyond a linked strategy post), and even notes low engagement with last year\u2019s results. It therefore gives a plausible but weakly substantiated justification: reasonable and clear, but lacking data on representativeness, past effectiveness, or how responses will be used in practice."

    "validation_notes": "The post\u2019s empirical claims are verifiable and accurate. The EA Forum post itself (Aug 6, 2025) states the dates, optional questions, estimated time, browser-saved answers, shorter flow for people who haven\u2019t visited in 12 months, and the planned close date (Aug 20). The linked survey form (forms.cea.community) confirms \u201cAll questions are optional,\u201d the browser-save/pause note, and an estimated ~15 minutes completion time. The post\u2019s claim that last year\u2019s survey informed the Forum strategy is supported by the Jan 2025 Forum strategy post, which explicitly cites survey data in its appendix. The 2023 survey-results post (Jul 26, 2024) shows the 609 responses and low engagement metrics referenced. Minor caveats: internal claims such as \u201cwe read every response\u201d or whether the survey was left open longer than Aug 20 are assertions from CEA/Forum staff and are not independently verifiable from public pages beyond those posts; branching logic (a \u2018\u2018significantly shorter survey\u2019\u2019 for non\u2011users) is strongly implied by the form content but exact question flow can only be fully confirmed by interacting with the live form.",

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Missing direct survey link (major usability issue). The post says \u201cTake the survey\u201d but doesn\u2019t include a clickable URL or button. Add the full survey URL and a prominent button/anchor near the top (and a plain-text link for people who can\u2019t open the button). This is the single most important fix \u2014 without it, readers can\u2019t act. \n\n2) Be explicit about privacy, data handling, and reporting. Say whether responses are anonymous, who on CEA/Forum will see raw answers, how long data will be kept, and whether/when you\u2019ll publish aggregated results or raw data. If you plan to publish a summary post (you mention wanting to), commit to a timeline and describe what will be reported. Readers often care whether their feedback is private and how it will be used. \n\n3) Strengthen the call-to-action and clarity on impact. Briefly state (in one sentence) what decisions you expect to make from this survey and why responding is worth 10\u201320 minutes. Clarify who you especially want to hear from (active posters, lurkers, newcomers), and add the survey close time zone for the August 20 deadline. These small additions increase response rates and reduce confusion.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback identifies three high-impact, actionable issues: the missing direct survey link is a major usability/activation failure (readers can\u2019t respond), privacy/data-handling details are commonly expected and affect willingness to participate, and a clearer CTA (what decisions will follow, target respondents, and exact timezone for the deadline) will raise response rates. These fixes are critical yet short and wouldn\u2019t bloat the post. Not a 9\u201310 because the problems aren\u2019t existential (they\u2019re fixable and not conceptually wrong), but they are important and the reviewer flags the right priorities."
