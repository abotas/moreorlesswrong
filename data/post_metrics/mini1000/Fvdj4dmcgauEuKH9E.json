    "explanation": "Moderately important for EA: the post highlights a real and under-discussed lever (bequests/estate giving) that could materially increase philanthropic resources if many people committed to large post\u2011mortem gifts. If the modeling is basically correct, it should influence EA fundraising priorities, promoting wills/pledges, and population-level strategy \u2014 but it is not foundational. Important caveats (time\u2011value of money, discounting of delayed impact, present control/influence, differing marginal value of donations across time and cause areas, behavioral and legal frictions, and uncertainty about who controls/operationalizes estate gifts) limit how much it should change core EA or longtermist approaches. For general humanity: minor-to-moderate importance \u2014 redistributing emphasis toward estate giving could raise philanthropic flows substantially, but it wouldn\u2019t by itself alter most high\u2011stakes policy or existential outcomes and faces practical, ethical, and timing constraints."

    "explanation": "Overall clear and well-organized: the post states a focused question, summarizes key findings up front, uses a helpful results table and TL;DR, and highlights real-world implications. Weaknesses for comprehension and argument clarity are that key model assumptions and methods are absent (how wealth/income, mortality, compounding, taxes, timing, and population heterogeneity are modeled), some terms are ambiguous (steady\u2011state, average annual donations), and there are a couple of small wording/typo issues. The post is concise but slightly repetitive in places. Adding a short methods summary and clarifying assumptions would make it much stronger and easier to evaluate."

    "explanation": "Within EA/longtermist circles the basic tradeoff between giving now vs leaving bequests is well known and people have repeatedly modelled timing, discounting, and estate/pledge strategies \u2014 so the core idea (estate gifts can outsize lifetime gifts) is not very novel to that audience. The more novel bits are the specific steady\u2011state population modelling and the strong quantitative claim that death\u2011based giving would dominate across parameterisations (e.g., 10% income vs 10\u201350% net worth at death always losing), which may not have been widely analyzed in that exact form. For the general public, the scale and implications (large annual sums unlocked by bequests and that modest % of net worth at death can exceed lifetime 10% income donations) will be fairly surprising to many people, so it\u2019s moderately novel there."

    "explanation": "Strengths: the post asks the right population-level question and reports a quantitative model with clear, intuitive claims (wealth-at-death can far exceed a year's income, so bequests can aggregate to large flows). The basic logic is plausible in many parameterizations. Weaknesses: the model is opaque (no equations, parameter values, age-wealth and mortality assumptions, discounting, or sensitivity analysis are provided), so key drivers (compound growth, mortality distribution, concentration of wealth, timing/value of funds) can\u2019t be evaluated. Important factors are omitted or glossed: time value of money, urgency/elasticity of philanthropic returns (marginal impact of donations now vs later), behavioral and legal feasibility of leaving large death gifts, and unsourced real-world figures. Because of those gaps, the claim is suggestive but not well-supported as a general conclusion."

    "validation_notes": "The post\u2019s central qualitative point \u2014 that large death/bequest gifts can produce very large one-time or steady flows and so, under some assumptions, estate-based giving can exceed lifetime annual giving \u2014 is plausible. However the post\u2019s specific quantitative claims are not verifiable from public data without the author\u2019s model details, and several numbers appear unlikely or are at best highly assumption-dependent. Key problems: (1) the headline table (1M altruists \u2192 10% income = $5B vs 10% of net worth at death = $13.1B) implies an average estate at death of roughly $13.1M (given ~1% deaths/year), which is far larger than typical per\u2011person wealth for a broad population and therefore requires strong assumptions (very high lifetime saving rates, high returns, or a non\u2011representative population) that aren\u2019t shown; (2) the claim \u201c~150,000 people die each year with >$2M and together hold $750B\u2013$1T at death\u201d is not supported by a clear public data source \u2014 available wealth reports give different counts of >$1M and >$5M people and do not support that specific combination of counts and totals without further assumptions; (3) the post\u2019s global philanthropy baseline (~$900B/year) is within the range of published estimates but definitions vary (some sources estimate ~$770B in cash gifts, others estimate $1.3T if volunteering/remittances or broader measures are included), so the \u2018half of global philanthropy\u2019 framing is plausible only under certain definitions. Overall: the qualitative direction of the argument is credible in some settings, but the quantitative claims (threshold of 750k givers, the table numbers, and the 150k/$750\u20131T figures) cannot be verified and likely rely on optimistic/unreported assumptions. The model should publish its demographic, income, saving, return, and mortality assumptions (and sensitivity analyses) before the numerical conclusions can be judged robust.",

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Missing timing/value-of-money and urgency considerations \u2014 you treat \"average annual donations\" as if a dollar in 30 years is the same as a dollar today. That both misrepresents the social value of earlier giving (time discounting, risk, and the ability to fund time-sensitive, high-ROI interventions) and can flip the comparison. Actionable fix: include present-value discounting and at least one scenario with realistic social discount rates (0\u201310%), plus sensitivity analysis. Model consequences of delaying funding for causes where early money has outsized impact (e.g., \uc0ac\uc5c5 creation, vaccine campaigns, existential-risk mitigation).\n\n2) Implausible/opaque lifecycle and estate assumptions \u2014 the model apparently assumes estates are fully available for gifts at stated percentages and ignores taxes, probate costs, legal/behavioral take-up, heterogeneity in ages/wealth, and who actually pledges such bequests. Actionable fix: explicitly model (or stress-test) key institutional frictions: estate/inheritance taxes, common bequest fractions (vs. heirs), probabilities people actually keep bequest pledges, and realistic age/wealth distributions. Show results when only a minority of wealthy people leave bequests, and when estates are lower than your central estimate.\n\n3) Overlooks differences in philanthropic effectiveness and counterfactuals \u2014 money given during life can be catalytic (matching, building organizations, leveraging policy change) and sometimes has much higher marginal return than money given later. Conversely, giving at death may be less flexible, more concentrated, or harder to channel to priority interventions. Actionable fix: add a paragraph and a simple quantitative scenario that compares dollars-for-dollars effectiveness (e.g., assume life-giving dollars are 2\u201310\u00d7 more or less effective than bequests) and show when the conclusions reverse. Also soften the title/claims to reflect the conditional nature of your result (e.g., \"Under these modeling assumptions, death-based giving often outperforms\").\n\nImplementing these three fixes (discounting & timing, realistic estate/legal/behavioral frictions, and cause-specific effectiveness/counterfactuals) will catch the largest potential \"own-goals\" and make the post much more robust and credible to an EA audience.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback hits the post's three biggest vulnerabilities: ignoring time-value/urgency of money, treating estates as fully liquid and available (no taxes/probate/behavioral take-up), and ignoring differences in the counterfactual effect of dollars given during life versus at death. Fixing these would substantially change interpretations and are necessary for credibility with an EA audience. The feedback is actionable and focused; it could be slightly improved by noting sensitivity to return assumptions and age/wealth heterogeneity, but as-is it identifies major 'own-goals' that would embarrass the author if unaddressed."
