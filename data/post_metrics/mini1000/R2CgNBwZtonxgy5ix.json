    "explanation": "This is a narrow, practical question about donor-facing transparency features (like AMF's donation tracking). It isn't foundational to EA or longtermist theory, but it has modest practical value: if more charities offered this kind of tracking it could increase donor trust, retention, and marginal funding flows to effective interventions. It therefore matters a bit to donor engagement and charity practice within the EA/donor community, but it has negligible importance for humanity at large."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Be much more specific about what you mean by \u201clike Against Malaria Foundation.\u201d Right now it\u2019s unclear whether you want (a) a per-donation webpage that lists each of your gifts and shows shipment/distribution stages, (b) project-level transparency reports (e.g. maps, photos, partner reports), or (c) any high-quality donor dashboard. Different charities meet different parts of that spectrum. Actionable fix: state the exact features you care about (e.g. \u201cI want per-donation tracking with shipment status and location-level distribution updates\u201d).\n\n2) Clarify scope and priorities (humans vs. farmed animals, geography, effectiveness). You combine two fairly different asks \u2014 \u201chelp humans\u201d and \u201chelp animals trapped in animal agriculture\u201d \u2014 which will invite many irrelevant answers. Also you imply AMF\u2019s tracking = EA effectiveness; that\u2019s a separate dimension. Actionable fix: say which cause areas you actually want recommendations for and whether you care more about the tracking feature itself or the charity\u2019s effectiveness according to EA standards.\n\n3) Show what you\u2019ve already tried / searched to avoid duplicates and make answers more useful. The post reads like you assume AMF is unique but you haven\u2019t listed search terms or examples you\u2019ve checked. Actionable fix: add a short \u201cwhat I looked for already\u201d list (sites, keywords, and 2\u20133 charities you checked) so responders can either point to ones you missed or explain why true per-donation tracking is rare.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback correctly pinpoints the post's main weaknesses: vagueness about what 'like AMF' means, conflation of tracking features with EA effectiveness, and lack of shown prior search effort. These are actionable, high-impact fixes that would substantially improve reply quality without requiring a long rewrite; they identify clear 'own-goals' the author would likely be embarrassed about once pointed out."

    "clarity_score": 7,
    "explanation": "Overall clear and easy to understand: the post states a concrete example (Against Malaria Foundation) and a clear ask (other charities with similar donation-tracking pages, including for animals). Strengths: specific example, understandable analogy (Amazon-style tracking), polite request. Weaknesses: informal tone, a few typos/grammar issues (e.g. 'against malaria foundation' lowercase, 'count y' likely 'country'), minor redundancy and run-on sentences; the criteria for what counts as 'like this' could be stated more precisely. With minor edits it would be very clear."

    "explanation": "EA readers are very likely already familiar with AMF\u2019s donor-tracking approach and with the general idea of seeking charities that publish detailed distribution/impact updates (GiveWell, GiveDirectly, some funders/orgs do similar tracking). The only mildly novel twist is asking specifically for that package-style tracking applied to charities focused on animals in industrial agriculture, but overall the post raises a fairly common/obvious request. For the general public the idea is somewhat less familiar but still intuitive \u2014 not highly original."

    "explanation": "The post presents a clear personal observation and preference (liking AMF's donor-tracking pages) and asks a reasonable question, so its basic logic is coherent. However it makes an unsupported generalization (\u201cto my knowledge it's the only one\u201d) without any systematic comparison or citations. Evidence is purely anecdotal (one positive example, one tentative counterexample) and there is no empirical or research backing. Overall the claim that AMF is unique is weakly supported; the post functions better as a request for information than as an argument backed by evidence."

    "validation_notes": "The poster\u2019s central empirical claim that Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) shows donors a personal page listing their donations and exactly which net distributions (with staged statuses from manufacture \u2192 distribution complete) is correct and well-documented. However the follow-up claim that AMF is effectively the only charity that provides this kind of donor-facing, item- or project-level tracking is incorrect: multiple other charities provide similar tracking/reportbacks (project pages with GPS and photos, order/shipping tracking, lender/donor dashboards). Strength: AMF transparency claim is verified. Weakness: uniqueness claim is contradicted by clear examples (charity: water, DonorsChoose, Kiva, Donatekart, The Water Project/Thirst Project).",
