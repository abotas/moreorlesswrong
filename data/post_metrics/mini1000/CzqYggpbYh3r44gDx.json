    "explanation": "This is a localized, practical request about funding and structuring a research project to influence Tasmanian policy. It is not advancing a foundational claim for EA priorities (e.g., AI safety or global health), so it is only modestly relevant to EAers interested in policy, advocacy, or funding mechanisms. If successful it could matter for Tasmania\u2019s governance, but it has very limited global scale or theoretical importance, so it is low-impact for humanity overall."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Missing research framing and feasibility \u2014 The post is too vague to turn into a PhD/postdoc proposal. Actionable fixes: (a) state a clear research question (e.g. \u201cWhat institutional reforms enabled rapid economic modernization in Norway and Singapore, and which of these are transferable to Tasmania?\u201d), (b) pick 1\u20132 methods (comparative case study + process tracing, archival research, elite interviews, or policy experiments) and describe the data you can access, (c) add realistic scope and timeline (PhD = 3\u20134 years, what a pilot year would show). This will make it credible to supervisors and funders.  \n\n2) Dangerous/unclear assumption of transferability \u2014 Treating Norway and Singapore as blueprints for Tasmania ignores huge contextual differences (scale, resource basis, political culture, legal constraints, international position) and problematic political trade-offs (e.g. Singapore\u2019s authoritarian elements). Actionable fixes: explicitly acknowledge these differences, add a paragraph on \u201cwhat transferability means\u201d (policy transfer vs. imitation vs. learning), and include criteria for evaluating suitability (political feasibility, legal compatibility, public acceptability). Consider comparing many small, democratic cases rather than focusing only on Norway/Singapore.  \n\n3) No plan for academic pathway or stakeholder strategy \u2014 The question about turning this into a PhD/postdoc needs concrete next steps. Actionable fixes: list potential host disciplines (comparative politics, public policy, development studies, political economy), suggest target universities and supervisors with relevant work (names if you can), describe what funders will expect (proposal, ethics approval, CV, prior research or pilot), and outline stakeholder engagement (Tasmanian government contacts, local universities, civil society) and risk management (political sensitivities, ethics, reputational risks). If you want help, share whether you want an academic route or a policy/consultancy route so advice can be tailored.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback targets the key flaws: extreme vagueness, a naive assumption of direct transferability from Norway/Singapore to Tasmania, and lack of an academic or stakeholder pathway. These are major issues the author would likely be embarrassed about if unchallenged, and the suggested fixes are concrete and actionable (research question, methods, scope, disciplines, engagement). It could be improved by briefly advising to soften the rhetorical framing (e.g. avoid \u2018make Tasmania the Norway down-under\u2019) and by pointing to the policy-transfer literature as a starting point, but overall the feedback is highly useful."

    "clarity_score": 6,
    "explanation": "The post is short, readable and communicates a clear, simple request (how to turn a funded project about political transformations into a PhD/postdoc). However it lacks key details that would make the ask actionable: it doesn't define terms (what counts as a 'revolution' or 'Norway down-under'), justify choice of case studies (Norway, Singapore), specify research questions, methods, disciplinary fit, or intended outcomes/stakeholders. Concise but missing necessary specificity."

    "explanation": "This proposal is largely a straightforward, common idea: commissioning comparative research on successful state-building/policy transfers and turning it into academic work is well-trodden (development studies, comparative politics, policy transfer literature). The only mildly specific aspect is applying Norway/Singapore-style lessons to Tasmania, but that is a narrow, incremental twist rather than a fundamentally new concept. Asking how to convert such work into a PhD/Postdoc is routine academic/practical planning rather than an original intellectual claim."

    "explanation": "This post is essentially a high-level proposal/question rather than an argued thesis. Strengths: a clear goal (wanting to learn from other countries to improve Tasmania) and initiative on fundraising. Weaknesses: almost no reasoning about why Norway or Singapore are the right comparisons, no articulation of causal mechanisms, no discussion of feasibility or political constraints, no operationalization of outcomes, and no methodological plan. There is no empirical evidence or citation of relevant literature; key issues like differences in scale, history, institutions, and international context are not addressed. To be persuasive it would need comparative-case reasoning, identification of mechanisms, metrics for success, acknowledgment of counterfactuals and constraints, and a concrete research design (process tracing, mixed methods, etc.)."

    "validation_notes": "Mixed / uncertain. The post\u2019s implicit empirical claims break into two parts: (1) Norway and Singapore are plausible examples of highly \u201csuccessful\u201d political/economic transformations \u2014 this is well supported by historical and economic data (high GDP per capita, well\u2011documented development strategies, Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund). (2) The unstated claim that those models can be straightforwardly implemented to make Tasmania \u201cthe Norway down\u2011under\u201d is much weaker: Tasmania is a subnational Australian jurisdiction with limited taxation/fiscal autonomy, very different resource endowments (no equivalent to Norway\u2019s petroleum revenues) and different institutional constraints; policy\u2011transfer literature warns that lessons do not transfer automatically and context matters. In short: the choice of Norway and Singapore as successful cases is supported, but the feasibility claim (replicating them in Tasmania) is uncertain and not empirically validated without detailed comparative research.",
