    "explanation": "For the EA/rationalist community this is a fairly important, actionable post: it challenges key assumptions and recalculates cost-effectiveness for a set of funded/incubated fish-welfare interventions, with direct implications for prioritisation, incubation and donation decisions within animal-welfare philanthropy. It\u2019s not foundational to EA as a whole (doesn't change core longtermist or AI-safety views), but is load-bearing within the animal-welfare funding subdomain because it could materially alter where resources are allocated. For general humanity the post is of low importance \u2014 it is highly technical and relevant mainly to specialist funders, NGOs and researchers rather than producing broad societal effects."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Check and fix how you adjust for sentience \u2014 you may have misapplied AIM\u2019s own adjustments. In several places you multiply AIM\u2019s WPs/$ by the reciprocal of AIM\u2019s sentience probability (1/0.526). That move is plausible only if AIM\u2019s WP estimates are explicitly conditional on sentience=1 and do not already incorporate the sentience probability; if AIM already adjusted their WPs for sentience your reciprocal will double-count. Actionable: verify (or show evidence in the post) whether each AIM WP estimate you use is (a) conditional on sentience or (b) already multiplied by AIM\u2019s sentience probability. If the source sheets aren\u2019t public, ask AIM for the specific cells and then re-run the calculations accordingly. Highlight any changed results in the post. \n\n2) Add sensitivity analysis and justify converting WPs/SADs to DALYs \u2014 your headline comparisons rely on a chain of strong scaling choices (using RP medians, applying a single 0.089 welfare-range, and mapping 100 WPs/year to 1 \u201cpractically maximal life\u201d = 0.01 DALY/WP). These assumptions are both uncertain and potentially incompatible across organisations\u2019 metrics (AIM WPs, AIM SADs, RP ranges). Actionable: replace single-point claims with a small sensitivity table (e.g. low/median/high or 10th/50th/90th percentiles for RP ranges; alternative WP\u2192DALY scalings) and report how your main ratios change. Explicitly state whether RP ranges and AIM WPs/SADs are commensurable and, if not, either (a) convert them defensibly or (b) limit comparisons to like-for-like metrics. This will prevent readers from treating the point estimates as definitive. \n\n3) Make explicit and (where possible) quantify non-immediate strategic values you now treat heuristically \u2014 incubation and funding decisions often trade immediate DALY-equivalents for value of information, ecosystem-building, tipping points, and options value. You mention these qualitatively, but your normative conclusion (AIM shouldn\u2019t have incubated X) rests mostly on short-run DALY/$. Actionable: either (a) include threshold / breakeven calculations showing how large the future/option value must be for a fish intervention to match cage-free campaigns, or (b) qualify the recommendation so readers know when strategic justifications could overturn the cost-effectiveness verdict. This will make the post\u2019s prescriptive claims proportionate to the uncertainty about long-run effects.",
    "improvement_potential": "Very useful. The three points hit major, concrete risks: likely double-counting of sentience (a clear own-goal that could materially change many headline numbers), lack of sensitivity analysis / ambiguous metric conversion (WPs/SADs \u2192 DALYs and mixing RP and AIM metrics), and insufficient treatment of strategic/future-value reasons for incubation. Fixing these would likely change key ratios and make the recommendations much more defensible, and can be done with targeted checks and a small sensitivity table rather than massively lengthening the post."

    "explanation": "The post is well structured (clear summary, context, calculations, discussion) and the main claim \u2014 that AIM\u2019s fish recommendations and FWI\u2019s farm program are much less cost-effective than chicken campaigns under different welfare-range assumptions \u2014 comes through. However, it is very dense and technical: long paragraphs, many inline numerical computations, acronyms (WPs, SADs, DALYs) and numerous external links make it hard to follow without careful, patient reading. Key assumptions and conversions are sometimes buried in the math rather than summarized, and some points are repeated. A concise plain\u2011language summary of core assumptions, a short table of the main numeric results, and clearer signposting of critical assumptions would substantially improve readability."

    "explanation": "For EA readers the post is moderately-to-strongly novel: it combines existing pieces (RP welfare ranges, AIM analyses, SADs/WP discussion) in a new diagnostic way \u2014 highlighting that AIM implicitly used a welfare-range-of-1 assumption, re-running cost\u2011effectiveness calculations with RP medians, quantifying large downstream changes, and critiquing measurement choices for intense suffering. Those specific recalculations and their implications for AIM/CAP/FWI incubation decisions are likely new to most Forum readers. For the general public the material is highly novel: the concepts (welfare ranges conditional on sentience, WPs vs SADs, DALY-equivalents for fish, and detailed cost\u2011effectiveness comparisons across niche charities) and the specific numeric revisions are specialized and unlikely to have been considered by an average educated person."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post identifies a clear, plausible modeling mistake in AIM\u2019s earlier analyses (treating welfare ranges conditional on sentience as 1), lays out transparent calculation steps, compares alternative assumptions (using Rethink Priorities medians), and tests implications across multiple interventions; it also acknowledges uncertainty and cites an independent IPA analysis that broadly concurs. Weaknesses: The conclusions rely on multiple strong and partly subjective conversions (WPs\u2192DALYs, choice of 0.01 DALY per WP, applying carp\u2019s welfare-range to diverse fish species), use some unpublished AIM data making replication harder, and depend heavily on RP\u2019s median ranges being correct. Overall, the argument is logically structured and persuasive that AIM/FWI cost-effectiveness estimates are sensitive to these assumptions, but empirical support is largely model-based and sensitive to contested parameter choices, so the claim is moderately but not decisively supported."

    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 7,
    "validation_notes": "Most of the post\u2019s key empirical foundations are supported by public sources: Rethink Priorities published the welfare-range estimates (carp median 0.089, salmon 0.056) in Jan 2023; Ambitious Impact (AIM) historically used a \u2018Welfare Points\u2019 system and organisations evaluating charities (e.g. ACE) report moving to AIM\u2019s Suffering\u2011Adjusted Days (SADs) in 2024; Charity Entrepreneurship / AIM incubated the Centre for Aquaculture Progress (CAP) in 2024; Fish Welfare Initiative (FWI) publicly reported 2024 program impact and ACE publicly updated their evaluation of FWI in 2024. These facts validate the post\u2019s broad claims about (a) the availability of RP welfare ranges since Jan 2023, (b) AIM\u2019s prior use of WPs and later move to SADs, (c) CAP incubation timing, and (d) ACE/FWI public numbers and assessments. However, many of the post\u2019s precise numerical conversions and final DALY/$ figures depend on private/organisation spreadsheets or internal cells the author references (AIM\u2019s old WP spreadsheets, an IPA spreadsheet commissioned by AIM, and some AIM pain-intensity cells) which are not publicly accessible; I could not independently reproduce all arithmetic steps that use those private inputs. I also could not find a public IPA report of the FWI cost-effectiveness analysis (the author describes an IPA spreadsheet last updated March 2024, but it appears to be internal). Thus the post is well\u2011supported at the methodological / documentary level, but some specific numeric multipliers and conversions rely on non\u2011public inputs and author assumptions and so cannot be fully independently verified from public sources.",
