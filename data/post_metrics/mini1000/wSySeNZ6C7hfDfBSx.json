    "explanation": "This is a methodologically interesting and potentially impactful contribution to the literature on the Easterlin Paradox and how we interpret subjective wellbeing data. For the EA/rationalist community it matters moderately (6) because many EA arguments and cost\u2011effectiveness calculations use reported life satisfaction to value material improvements; if rescaling is real and large, it would change how strongly we weight GDP growth and some wellbeing interventions. The post\u2019s novel test (using panel life\u2011events) and robustness checks make it worth attention, and it points to further research (and collaboration with academics) that could change empirical priors. However, the result is tentative, relies on strong identifying assumptions (constant true event impacts and an unchanged \u201c0/10\u201d baseline), uses one country dataset (SOEP/Germany), and only identifies certain types of scaling, so it is not yet load\u2011bearing for major EA or policy decisions.\n\n  For general humanity it is of minor-to-moderate interest (4). If true, the finding would change public narratives about the value of economic growth and how much happier people actually are today, but it would not immediately alter most pressing global problems (e.g., pandemics, climate, existential risks). Overall: a promising, useful piece that merits follow\u2011up and replication before being treated as decisive."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Reliance on two very strong identifying assumptions (constant true event impacts; constant 0/10 baseline) is the single biggest weakness. These assumptions are far from obvious and drive your 60% adjustment. You should (a) make these assumptions explicit up front in the post (not buried later), (b) discuss concrete mechanisms by which each could plausibly fail (e.g., welfare/state supports, medical advances, reduced stigma, changes in family structure that reduce the true psychological impact of unemployment or bereavement), and (c) run or report sensitivity checks that relax each assumption (e.g., lower/higher bounds on attenuation, partial-adjustment scenarios). Don\u2019t just claim you can\u2019t think of why the true effects would change \u2014 attempt to falsify that claim with data-driven tests (see point 3).\n\n2) Overlooked sources of non-rescaling explanations and measurement confounders. Many plausible, concrete channels could make reported event effects fall even if the reporting scale is stable: changes in event severity (shorter unemployment spells, better bereavement services), changing selection into events, survey mode/question wording changes, or changed salience/expectation of events. Actionable suggestions: add placebo tests (events whose true severity plausibly changed in known directions), control for objective mediators (length of unemployment, income replacement, hospitalization), test for survey/mode changes over time, and check whether the frequency, duration, or objective severity of the events has changed in SOEP. If you can show event frequency/duration/severity is stable while subjective effect shrinks, that strengthens the rescaling claim.\n\n3) Identification and meta-aggregation choices need clearer justification and robustness checks. The normalization step (setting first-period effects to 1 and meta-weighting) and the claim that a 40% average attenuation implies a 1.6x scale stretch are nontrivial transformations that merit more transparency and sensitivity analysis. Actionable items: (a) report un-normalized event-level trends and per-event confidence bands (not only the meta-index), (b) try alternative aggregation/weighting schemes and show how the 40% number moves, (c) run placebo/time-permutation tests (e.g., randomly assign years to test whether your procedure spuriously finds attenuation), and (d) where possible replicate on another panel dataset or country (or split the SOEP sample) to demonstrate the result isn\u2019t idiosyncratic to one dataset or one normalization choice.\n\nIf you address these three areas (explicitly flagging and stress-testing assumptions, ruling out non-rescaling mechanisms with concrete tests, and showing robustness to aggregation/identification choices), the claims will be much more defensible and useful to EA readers.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback flags the post\u2019s three biggest vulnerabilities \u2014 the two strong identifying assumptions, plausible non-rescaling explanations/measurement confounders, and the nontrivial normalization/meta-aggregation \u2014 and gives concrete, actionable tests the author can run or report. Fixing these would materially strengthen (or appropriately weaken) the headline claims without requiring irrelevant length. It stops short of showing the thesis is impossible, so not a 10, but it\u2019s critical and very useful."

    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "Overall the post is well-structured and readable: it opens with a clear TLDR, lays out background, defines the key concept (rescaling), explains the empirical strategy, and lists assumptions and implications. Strengths: logical flow, explicit assumptions and robustness checks, and helpful signposting make the argument easy to follow for an informed reader. Weaknesses: a few methodological details (exact meta\u2011averaging/weighting, event selection criteria, and controls) are glossed over and would help readers judge credibility; some sentences are wordy and there is some technical jargon that may slow non\u2011specialist readers. Concision is generally good but the post could be tightened by trimming repetition and adding one-sentence clarifications where methods are summarized."

    "explanation": "The post applies a relatively new and intuitive empirical test for \u2018rescaling\u2019 \u2014 using attenuation in the measured impact of major life events over time (with a meta\u2011average on a large SOEP panel) to infer stretching of the LS scale and to estimate a sizable adjustment (~60%). That specific life\u2011events-as\u2011ruler approach and the concrete magnitude estimate are fairly original for the EA readership and go beyond the more commonly discussed explanations (hedonic adaptation, social comparison). However it is not completely novel in the broader academic context: recent work (e.g. Prati & Senik\u2019s recall approach), the literature on anchoring vignettes/response\u2011shift in survey research, and other scale\u2011norming discussions overlap with the core idea that reporting functions change. For a general (educated) audience the idea and method will be quite new and surprising, but among specialists it is a defensible moderate\u2011to\u2011high novelty contribution rather than a radical breakthrough."

    "explanation": "Strengths: the post uses a plausible, novel identification strategy (panel differencing on SOEP life\u2011events), examines multiple events, and reports many robustness checks; the logic linking smaller reported event effects to rescaling is clear and well-motivated. Weaknesses: the approach rests on strong, largely untested assumptions (that the true psychological impact of events and the \u20180/10\u2019 baseline are constant), and there are several plausible alternative explanations (changes in institutions, support systems, stigma, prevalence/habituation, survey mode/wording, sample composition) that could produce the same pattern. Evidence is limited to one country panel, small effect sizes, and the summary here omits uncertainty bounds and sensitivity detail; overall the thesis is interesting and moderately supported but not yet compelling without further tests and checks (other countries, direct tests of the key assumptions, and more diagnostic sensitivity analyses)."

    "validation_notes": "Summary: The post\u2019s high-level claims are plausible and consistent with existing literature (the Easterlin paradox is a real, contested empirical regularity; reporting-scale / scale\u2011use heterogeneity is a recognised problem). Several cited and related papers (Prati & Senik 2025; Bond & Lang 2019; Benjamin et al. 2023/24; Kaiser 2022) document mechanisms or methods that support the plausibility of \u201crescaling.\u201d The author\u2019s use of SOEP (v39, 1984\u20132022) is appropriate and the dataset is large (so ~650k person\u2011wave observations is plausible). However, the key quantitative results claimed in the post (the ~40% decline in life\u2011event effect sizes across 1991\u20132022 and the 60% BOTEC uplift to mean life satisfaction) depend on the author\u2019s specific choices, strong identifying assumptions, and unpublished code/estimates. Those numerical claims cannot be independently verified from public sources alone; they are therefore credible but currently provisional. Important supporting facts I checked: (a) the wider measurement problem in happiness research is well documented; (b) memory\u2011based rescaling work (Prati & Senik) exists; (c) prior SOEP life\u2011event/adaptation studies have been done. Limitations: I could not reproduce the author\u2019s meta\u2011analysis or robustness checks (no public code/data attached to the EA post), and identification of a scale \u201cstretch\u201d is known to be difficult (Bond & Lang, Benjamin et al.). Overall: the conceptual claims are well grounded; the specific quantitative corrections proposed are interesting but need replication / code and additional corroboration before being taken as solid facts.",
