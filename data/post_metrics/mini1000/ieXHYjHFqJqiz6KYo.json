    "explanation": "This is a useful, pragmatic contribution for EA local organizers: a tested workbook that can improve member onboarding, retention, and programming decisions and could modestly increase local impact. However its scope is operational and local rather than theoretical or strategic \u2014 it is not load\u2011bearing for EA\u2019s core arguments or high\u2011stakes priorities. For general humanity the post is essentially irrelevant beyond a small community benefit."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Lack of rigorous evaluation / weak evidence: You report \u201cpromising\u201d qualitative feedback from 8 participants but give no measurable outcomes, no pre/post data, and no plan for attributing change to the workbook rather than other factors. Actionable fix: add a short evaluation plan in the post (or link to one) with concrete metrics you will track (e.g., follow-up on 3\u20116 month career actions, event attendance, self\u2011rated clarity on next steps), sample sizes/targets, and a simple before/after or comparison approach (e.g., cohort using workbook vs. cohort not using it). If you can\u2019t run that now, explicitly call out this limitation and how you\u2019ll address it.  \n\n2) Sample, selection bias, and scalability concerns are underexplored: The post doesn\u2019t say who the 8 participants were, how they were recruited, or how much organizer time the workbook requires. That makes it hard for other groups to judge generalisability or the implementation burden. Actionable fix: include a one\u2011paragraph \u201cwho we tested with\u201d (demographics, recruitment), and add an estimated time/cost checklist for organizers (initial setup, per\u2011member coaching time, maintenance). Consider adding a low\u2011effort \u201clite\u201d version and a recommended workflow (e.g., templates + 30\u2011minute one\u2011on\u2011one) so groups with different capacity can adopt it.  \n\n3) Data/privacy and ownership issues are overlooked: You recommend tracking member progress and collecting data but don\u2019t mention consent, storage, anonymity, or who owns the sheets. Actionable fix: add a short privacy note and a suggested consent template (opt\u2011in, anonymisation, retention period), plus guidance on where to store workbooks (group account vs. personal) and an example minimal dataset to collect that balances usefulness with privacy/GDPR concerns.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback calls out three high-impact, concrete gaps\u2014lack of rigorous evaluation/attribution, unclear sampling/selection and scalability/organizer burden, and missing data/privacy guidance\u2014that are central to whether other groups can trust and adopt the workbook. The suggested fixes are actionable and would materially strengthen the post without excessive lengthening (they can be linked or summarized). It misses some secondary issues (e.g., how this differs from existing tools, inclusion/diversity concerns), but overall targets the main weaknesses that would embarrass the author if left unaddressed."

    "explanation": "No evidence of a widely recognized EA/rationalist figure by this name up to mid\u20112024.

    "post_id": "ieXHYjHFqJqiz6KYo",
    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The post is well-structured and easy to follow: strong TL;DR, clear headings, concrete description of the workbook and how to use it, and actionable next steps. It makes its point persuasively with practical examples and organizer-focused recommendations. It loses a bit of conciseness due to some repetition (multiple CTAs/links, repeated encouragements) and could be stronger with brief quantified outcomes or clearer evidence of impact, plus slightly less design jargon for broader accessibility."

    "novelty_ea": 2,
    "novelty_humanity": 3,
    "explanation": "This is an incremental, practical contribution rather than a novel conceptual idea. The most original elements are the specific framing for EA (three tailored tracks, a \u2018choose-your-own\u2019 option, and using the workbook to both guide members and collect impact data for organisers). However, journey-maps, workbooks, SMART goals, and post-onboarding career/engagement tracks are commonplace in EA groups and broader community/org development practice, so EA-savvy readers will find it unsurprising. To the general public it\u2019s slightly more novel only insofar as it\u2019s tailored to EA\u2019s aims, but the core idea (structured workbook for post-onboarding engagement and planning) is familiar in many domains."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post presents a clear problem, uses user-centered design methods, and lays out a coherent, actionable tool and use-cases for organizers. The argument that structured, tailored member journeys could help is plausible and well-explained. Weaknesses: The empirical support is limited and mostly anecdotal \u2014 interview sample size is unspecified, the pilot involved only eight participants, feedback is qualitative and not shown, there are no outcome metrics or comparisons, and claims about impact and scalability are largely aspirational. That makes the reasoning believable but under-supported by robust evidence."

    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 7,
    "validation_notes": "Strengths: The core empirical claims about the existence of the Impact Workbook, its public availability, and the author's role are well-supported. The EA Forum post by Brooke O\u2019Connell describing the workbook is publicly posted, Brooke\u2019s EA Forum profile and the EA Delft website list her as part of EA Delft\u2019s organising/board, and the cited Google Sheets workbook and example workbooks are accessible (template shows last-updated Jan 2025). Weaknesses / limits: Process and impact claims (that Brooke conducted one-on-one interviews in Spring 2024; that the workbook was tested with a cohort of eight fellows last Fall; that qualitative feedback has been positive; and that other local groups will adopt it in Q1 2025) are primarily self-reported in the post and workbook materials and lack independent third\u2011party corroboration or publicly shared metrics. These outcome/impact claims are plausible but not independently verifiable from public sources at the time of checking.",
