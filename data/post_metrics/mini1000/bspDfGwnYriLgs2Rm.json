    "explanation": "A practical, low\u2011stakes operational resource that modestly improves discoverability of advisory support for people entering AI safety. It can help funnel and orient new talent and slightly increase effective contributions, but it is not foundational to EA or AI\u2011safety theory or policy. It has negligible direct impact on humanity at large."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) No transparency about vetting, qualifications, or conflicts of interest \u2014 big trust issue\n- Problem: The post (and presumably the page) doesn\u2019t say how advisors are selected, whether their identities/affiliations are verified, or whether they\u2019re compensated or have conflicts of interest. Readers reasonably assume a directory of \u2018AI safety advisors\u2019 implies some quality control. Without it, newcomers could get poor or biased advice or be routed to people with commercial/organisational agendas.\n- Actionable fixes: Add a short paragraph to the post and a visible section on the page summarising inclusion criteria and verification steps (e.g., required profile fields, proof of affiliation or experience, whether you check backgrounds). Require advisors to disclose affiliations, paid relationships, and areas of expertise and show those disclosures on each listing (or add verification/badge states such as \u201cself-listed\u201d, \u201cverified affiliation\u201d, \u201ccommunity-vetted\u201d).\n\n2) Review/ranking system risks (gaming, low-quality/harmful advice) left unaddressed\n- Problem: You invite people to help \u201crefine the inclusion and ranking\u201d via reviews, but don\u2019t describe moderation, anti-gaming measures, or thresholds. Open review systems can be manipulated, polarising, and may expose newcomers to unvetted advice if rankings are shown prominently.\n- Actionable fixes: Before advertising reviews as a ranking mechanism, add visible safeguards: require reviewer accounts and a minimum verification level to post reviews, moderate or manually approve reviews initially, display review counts and average only after a minimum number of independent reviews, and add a reporting/appeals workflow for problematic listings. Consider delaying public ranking until you have moderation capacity.\n\n3) Missing practical guidance for advisees (and safety/privacy guidance)\n- Problem: Newcomers may not know how to choose the right advisor, what to prepare, or what not to share (sensitive IP, credentials). That increases the chance of bad calls and wasted time.\n- Actionable fixes: Add a short \u201cFor people seeking advice\u201d blurb in the post and on the page: how to pick an advisor (match by expertise/goals), a 3\u20135 item prep checklist (goal for call, CV/experience summary, specific questions), a brief safety/privacy note (don\u2019t share passwords, proprietary code, NDAs), and guidance on when to escalate/report concerning behaviour. This can be a tiny FAQ box and prevents avoidable problems.\n\nOverall: these three changes are high-impact, short to implement, and will materially reduce risks and increase trust in the resource. If you want, I can suggest concise copy (1\u20133 sentences each) you could drop into the post and the advisors page.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback identifies real, high-impact weaknesses: no statement of vetting/conflicts undermines trust and could route newcomers to biased or unqualified advisors; flagging review/ranking abuse and moderation needs is crucial if the site will surface \u2018ranked\u2019 advisors; and adding brief prep/privacy guidance for advisees is a small add that prevents predictable problems. These are actionable, short-to-implement fixes that materially improve the post and the resource without bloating it. (Not a fatal error, so not a 9\u201310, but omitting these feels like a significant oversight.)"

It could be improved by briefly stating inclusion/ranking criteria, any costs or time expectations for calls, and who the target audience is (absolute newcomers vs those with some experience), and the image could use alt text."

    "explanation": "This is mainly an announcement of a practical curated directory (and sign-up/review workflow) for AI-safety advisory calls. For EA Forum readers this is low-novelty\u2014the community already runs/uses advisory calls (80,000 Hours, mentoring, org-specific lists), so centralising them is useful but not conceptually new. For the general public it is a bit more novel since a dedicated, consolidated portal for AI-safety advisors is less likely to be known, but the underlying idea (a directory of advisors/consultations) is commonplace."

    "overall_support": 4,
    "explanation": "The post's reasoning is straightforward and plausible (making advisors easier to find should increase uptake of advisory calls, and giving people a single discoverable page is a sensible intervention). However, it provides almost no empirical evidence \u2014 only an anecdote \u2014 and doesn\u2019t address important issues (how visibility will be measured, advisor vetting/quality control, capacity constraints, or potential harms). That makes the overall support modest: the proposal is reasonable but weakly substantiated."

    "validation_notes": "Most major empirical claims in the post are verifiable and accurate: the AISafety.com \u201cSpeak to an advisor\u201d page exists, lists well over 14 advisors (the live page shows ~18 entries), includes links to booking tools (e.g. calendly / calendar.google.com / cal.com) for several advisors, and provides a \u2018Suggest\u2019 and \u2018Review\u2019 pathway. The EA Forum / LessWrong post by Bryce Robertson announcing the resource (21 Jan 2025) is also real. Weaknesses: the post\u2019s subjective claim that \u201cmany people \u2026 aren\u2019t aware of them\u201d is plausible but not empirically demonstrated in the post, and the author\u2019s anecdote about their own career origin (a call with 80,000 Hours) is personal and not independently verifiable from these sources. Overall: the factual, checkable claims are well supported; a few subjective/anecdotal statements remain unverified.",
