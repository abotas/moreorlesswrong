    "explanation": "This is a solid, practical descriptive resource for the EA movement: it documents where EAs live, engagement/satisfaction differences, group membership, and regional cause preferences. That information is useful for movement builders, funders, and researchers who must decide where to run events, recruit, or target outreach, and it helps interpret other survey results (e.g. geographic variation in longtermist views). However, it is not foundational to core EA/ethical claims or to major policy decisions; its scope is mostly organizational and descriptive. It has very limited direct relevance to general humanity beyond informing niche community strategy."

    "explanation": "The post is well-structured with clear headings, bullet summaries, and logical flow (countries \u2192 cities \u2192 demographics \u2192 engagement \u2192 causes \u2192 groups). Key findings are stated up front and supported by figures, which aids comprehension for the intended EA audience. Weaknesses: it relies heavily on embedded images (limiting standalone readability), contains some repetition and long paragraphs, uses jargon/abbreviations (e.g. LT > NT) without immediate definition, and includes a few technical/statistical notes (p-values, multiple comparisons) that could be clearer or more concise. Overall clear and easy to follow for readers familiar with EA reports, but could be tightened for broader accessibility."

    "explanation": "Most of the post reports incremental, expected findings for people familiar with EA (US/UK dominance, hub cities, young/male skew, longtermist/neartermist patterns). The modestly novel elements are methodological (first systematic look at country of origin vs current residence) and a few specific empirical results (e.g. Switzerland's very high relative in\u2011flow, UK having higher engagement and relatively stronger AI prioritization, low local\u2011group membership in large/longstanding hubs). For a general educated reader the concrete numbers and maps are new information but not conceptually surprising."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post is well-structured and cautious, presents clear descriptive statistics, visualisations, and explicitly notes caveats (small samples, survey responsiveness, measurement issues, and potential confounders). It uses reasonable comparative and correlational analyses and flags unplanned tests and multiple-comparison issues. Weaknesses: The evidence is survey-based and subject to self-selection and representativeness limits; many country/city estimates are imprecise, some hypothesis tests are uncorrected, and causal interpretations are limited. Overall the claims about respondents are well supported; broader generalisation about the EA population or causal mechanisms is weaker."

    "validation_notes": "Most major empirical claims in the post are directly supported by the primary EA Survey 2024 materials published on the EA Forum and Rethink Priorities (the geography post includes the country/city percentages, student rates, engagement and satisfaction scores, migration/inflow figures such as Switzerland\u2019s ~62% in\u2011flows, and group\u2011membership percentages). The survey team\u2019s Demographics post documents the sample (N = 2,078) and reiterates key caveats about representativeness and small subgroup sample sizes. Strengths: claims are traceable to the survey team\u2019s analyses and figures. Weaknesses / caveats: the survey is non\u2011probability/self\u2011selected (limits external generalisability), many country/city estimates have small Ns so are imprecise, some hypothesis tests were unplanned and not corrected for multiple comparisons (the post flags this), and several percentages are rounded in the narrative. Given strong primary-source support but important methodological caveats, a rating of 8 (well-supported) is appropriate.",

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Major representativeness / sampling-bias issue (urgent). The post treats respondent percentages as if they map directly to the EA population in each country/hub, but recruitment and response patterns (e.g. local group pushes, English-language bias, differential internet access) almost certainly produce large biases. Actionable fixes: add a short, prominent Methods/Limits box stating how the survey was advertised, who was invited, and the (non)existence of a sampling frame; show raw Ns for every country/city alongside percentages; flag results based on small samples (e.g. n<25) and avoid firm conclusions for them; consider and report any weighting or sensitivity analyses (or explicitly state you did not weight and why). This will prevent readers from over-interpreting the geographic shares and hub comparisons.\n\n2) Inferential/statistics problems: unplanned significance tests, no uncertainty intervals, and overinterpretation of small differences. The post reports p-values for country comparisons but admits tests were unplanned and uncorrected for multiple comparisons, and many differences described as \u201csignificant\u201d are tiny in magnitude. Actionable fixes: report sample sizes and 95% confidence intervals or standard errors for all means/percentages in tables/figures; report effect sizes (e.g. Cohen\u2019s d or absolute percentage-point differences) not just p-values; either correct for multiple comparisons (or clearly label analyses as exploratory) and remove strong language about \u201csignificance\u201d where power is low; and refrain from substantive claims when differences are both statistically marginal and substantively tiny.\n\n3) Interpretation of flows, causality, and subgroup differences is overstated. The Sankey and origin/residence descriptions imply meaningful migration patterns and causal explanations (e.g. tenure explains lower satisfaction) without baseline EA population denominators, time windows, or multivariate controls. Actionable fixes: clarify that flows reflect origins of respondents (not migration rates over a given period) and provide denominators or timelines if available; avoid causal wording (e.g. \u201cexplained by\u201d) unless you run appropriate regressions controlling for age, tenure, hub, and other confounders \u2014 or else explicitly label such analyses as correlational and exploratory; if possible include simple adjusted analyses (e.g. regression of satisfaction on tenure + country) or remove causal-sounding sentences.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback targets major, high-impact problems: treating raw respondent shares as representative, running/claiming unplanned significance tests without uncertainty or multiplicity correction, and making causal or overconfident interpretations of flows and subgroup differences. Fixing these would substantially reduce misleading claims and reader misinterpretation, and can mostly be done succinctly (methods/limits box, show Ns/CIs, label exploratory tests, temper causal language). It stops short of saying the entire descriptive content is invalid, so a 9 is appropriate rather than a 10."
