    "explanation": "Practical, high\u2011quality advice on how to disagree productively that can improve epistemic norms, reduce tribalism, and make EA/rationalist discussions more efficient and less wasteful. It's useful and somewhat load\u2011bearing for community culture and collective decision\u2011making, but it is not a foundational or novel theoretical claim \u2014 if wrong it would mainly mean slower cultural improvement rather than large harms. For general humanity the guidance is helpful for better conversations but not critical at scale; one post won't shift societal polarization by itself."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Missing handling of bad-faith actors and power asymmetries (big practical gap). The schema assumes interlocutors will answer honestly and that conversational power is symmetric. In many EA-forum / public debates that is false. Add a short section listing red flags (e.g. repeated straw-manning, refusing to answer willingness-to-change, public\u2011posturing, doxxing threats, clear performance/tribal signalling) and concrete responses: when to disengage, when to set boundaries (\"I won't continue if X keeps happening\"), when to move to private or mediated conversation, and when to document vs delete the exchange. This is high\u2011leverage because it prevents the whole schema from backfiring in hostile contexts. Concretely: a one-paragraph rule-set + 3 short templates (disengage template, boundary template, escalation template) would suffice. \n\n2) No prioritisation/decision flow or concrete examples \u2014 makes the schema hard to use. You give many useful prompts but not a lightweight way to choose which to use or when to stop. Add (a) a 3-step decision flow at the top: quick triage (taste vs important), assess openness (willingness-to-change question), decide audience (private, persuade person, signal to others), then apply appropriate subset of prompts; (b) collapse the three \"Open-mindedness\" sections into one concise set of moves; and (c) include 1\u20132 very short example dialogues (one productive, one bad-faith) showing which questions you actually ask and what counts as progress. This keeps the post short while making it actionable. \n\n3) Unclear terms, unsupported claims, and repetition \u2014 hurts credibility and readability. Define or replace jargon (\"other-siding\", \"Ideological Turing Test\", \"Double-Crux\") or link to a one\u2011line definition. Avoid repeated ideas (three separate \"open-mindedness\" subsections feel redundant) and tighten phrasing like \"police the use of logic\" (explain what policing means in practice). Where you make empirical claims about persuasion, identity, or testimony, either cite a short source list (e.g. motivated reasoning literature, work on identity-protective cognition, or Graham's Hierarchy link) or flag them as normative heuristics. This will prevent readers from dismissing the post as anecdotal advice and will reduce requests for clarification.",
    "improvement_potential": "Helps catch major practical gaps: missing guidance for bad-faith actors/power asymmetries (safety risk), lack of a lightweight decision flow and concrete examples (usability problem), and unclear jargon/repetition (credibility/readability). These fixes are high-leverage and mostly compact to implement, so addressing them would substantially improve the post without breaking its brevity\u2014hence a strong but not maximal score."

Strengths: concise numbered steps, practical prompts, and useful emphasis on checking understanding and incentives.

    "explanation": "Most elements (steelmanning, charity, 'consider the opposite', double-crux, check confidence, ask for examples/citations) are already familiar to EA/LessWrong/CFAR audiences, so the overall package is not very novel for EA readers. The post\u2019s value is more in packaging these practices into a concise checklist and emphasising practical points (ask if they\u2019re willing to change, check behavioural incentives, explicit time-worth assessment, \u2018Ideological Turing Test + validation\u2019), which is somewhat less obvious to the general public but still draws on well-known dispute-resolution and communication literature. Those small emphases are the most original parts."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post presents a coherent, well-structured checklist that captures many plausible factors in productive disagreement (open\u2011mindedness, audience, comprehension, incentives, other\u2011siding, checking confidence/evidence). Its logic is intuitive and internally consistent and it touches on useful practices (double\u2011crux, clarifying questions, visualising being wrong). Weaknesses: It is largely prescriptive and anecdotal rather than argued from first principles or empirical findings; it omits discussion of tradeoffs, contexts where items are impractical, and how to prioritize steps. Evidence is minimal (one blog reference and an xkcd link) and it cites no social\u2011psychology, persuasion, or communication research to substantiate claims. Overall: sensible and useful as a heuristic, but weakly supported by evidence and lacking justification for why this schema is better than alternatives or how well it works in practice."

    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 7,
    "validation_notes": "Most of the post is prescriptive/normative (a conversational schema) rather than making strong empirical claims. The few empirical assertions it makes \u2014 (a) that Paul Graham\u2019s Disagreement Hierarchy emphasizes quotation/logic, (b) that refuting testimony/claims can be difficult in short interactions, (c) that identity/tribal motivations affect willingness to change one\u2019s mind, and (d) that checking comprehension/active listening helps communication \u2014 are supported by reliable sources. Paul Graham\u2019s essay does present the hierarchy; social-epistemology literature documents difficulty of rebutting testimonial/deferential beliefs; political-psychology work (e.g., identity-protective cognition and the backfire-effect literature) shows group-identity strongly shapes receptivity to corrections; communication and clinical literature (teach-back/active listening) shows comprehension checks improve understanding. Caveats: many recommendations are normative (hard to \u2018verify\u2019), and empirical effects (e.g., backfire, persuasion) are context-dependent and can vary by study/design. Overall: good evidence for the empirical premises cited, but not all points are strictly empirical claims and some generalizations need context-specific qualification.",
