    "explanation": "A thoughtful, concrete research agenda for studying how to elicit 'valid' human intuitions has useful relevance to EA priorities (alignment, scalable oversight, forecasting, and improving rater quality). If pursued, it could yield important empirical techniques for preference elicitation and human-in-the-loop systems. However the post is exploratory, largely speculative, and presents only weak pilot evidence, so it is not foundational or decisive for current high\u2011stakes decisions. For general humanity it is a niche academic proposal with modest near\u2011term impact unless it catalyzes a larger, successful research program."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Major methodological problems with the Manifold/survey evidence \u2014 fix before leaning on it. You don\u2019t report sample size, respondent characteristics, power, or pre-registration; the survey is self\u2011selected, self\u2011report, and the betting market incentivization/subsidy probably changed who participated. Brier Skill Score is reasonable but you need to (a) report N and descriptive stats, (b) show robustness checks (e.g. raw Brier, BSS, exclusion of extreme markets), (c) correct for multiple comparisons, and (d) avoid causal claims from mere correlations. Actionable edits: add N, demographics, links to raw data/code, CI/SE for correlations, multiple\u2011comparison correction, and a short paragraph explicitly listing these limitations. If you want stronger evidence, run a pre\u2011registered randomized experiment that manipulates elicitation techniques and measures actual forecasting performance rather than perceived usefulness. \n\n2) Conceptual vagueness and overgeneralization between forecasting and moral/introspective intuitions. The post moves from forecasting techniques to claims about moral intuitions and alignment without defining \u201cvalid intuitions\u201d or justifying generalizability across domains. That\u2019s a large assumption readers will question. Actionable edits: (a) define \u201cvalid intuition\u201d up front and state clearly whether you mean calibration for forecasting, normative plausibility for moral judgments, or something else, (b) separate the forecasting pilot from the moral/alignment hypotheses and avoid generalizing results across them, or explicitly justify why mechanisms should transfer, and (c) give a concrete operationalization for any future moral\u2011elicitation experiments you propose.\n\n3) Taxonomy, item clarity, and analysis transparency need work. The strategy list appears ad hoc and some items are ambiguous (which you note), making interpretation of null/weak correlations tenuous. The \u201cadjusted correlation\u201d (demeaning ratings) is an unusual post hoc transform that requires justification. Actionable edits: pretest and validate the taxonomy (e.g. qualitative interviews with superforecasters), give exact survey wording for each item (or a link), explain and justify the adjusted correlation procedure (or replace it with standard methods such as controlling for mean rating in regression), and show sensitivity analyses (e.g. remove ambiguous items, factor analysis to see whether items load on coherent constructs). These changes will make the empirical piece much more credible and useful to readers.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback hits the post's two biggest vulnerabilities: weak, under-documented empirical evidence and an unsupported conceptual leap from forecasting techniques to moral/alignment intuitions. It points out concrete methodological omissions (N, demographics, pre-registration, robustness checks, multiple comparisons, strange transformations) that would embarrass the author if readers noticed, and gives actionable fixes that won\u2019t unduly bloat the post (add data/code, CIs, a limitations paragraph, or run a preregistered experiment). It also rightly demands clearer definitions and domain separation and calls for taxonomy validation and transparent analysis \u2014 all critical for credibility. Not a 10 because the post\u2019s exploratory framing isn\u2019t fatally flawed, but without these fixes the empirical claims and generalizations are likely to be misleading."

    "explanation": "The post is generally well-structured and communicates a clear central research question (how to elicit valid intuitions), with useful context, examples and a concrete toy study\u2014so it will be understandable to the EA/cognitive-science audience. Weaknesses: it's long and somewhat dense, uses jargon and speculative tangents (alignment, extrapolation types) that dilute the main thread, and the empirical/forecasting section is presentation-heavy and could be clearer about methods, limitations and takeaways. It would benefit from tighter summarizing and clearer presentation of the survey/table results."

    "novelty_humanity": 6,
    "explanation": "Most of the core ideas are familiar to EA/alignment readers \u2014 combining intuition with analysis, thought experiments, connectivist-style construction of intuitions, chain-of-thought analogies, and concerns about preference elicitation and scalable oversight are already discussed in EA and alignment literatures. The empirical toy (Manifold + survey + Brier Skill adjustment) and the explicit call to systematize \u2018methods of prompting the mind\u2019 are somewhat concrete/operative contributions but are incremental rather than groundbreaking for that audience. For a general educated reader the package is more novel: the specific framing (operationalizing \u201cvalid intuitions,\u201d linking human CoT to AI oversight, the taxonomy of prompting techniques and the simple Manifold experiment) brings together concepts that most non\u2011specialists are unlikely to have encountered, so it rates moderately novel there."
