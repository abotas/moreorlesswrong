    "explanation": "This post is a clear, compact defence and pedagogical restatement of core EA ideas (cause\u2011neutrality, cooperative/utilitarian prioritization, and marginal-cost thinking). It\u2019s useful within the EA/rationalist community for outreach, teaching, and clarifying common objections (so moderate importance), but it advances little that is novel or technically load\u2011bearing for EA strategy or policy. For general humanity the piece is of limited direct importance: the underlying principles could matter a great deal if widely adopted, but this particular post is mainly conceptual advocacy/ideal theory and unlikely on its own to change large\u2011scale decisions or institutions."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Over\u2011reliance on ideal theory and too little guidance for non\u2011ideal implementation. Problem: you repeatedly lean on an ideal two\u2011step schema and then wave away practical complications as \"limitations of ideal theory,\" but the reader is left without actionable guidance for the messy realities that make or break EA projects (politics, incentives, verification, enforcement, capacity constraints). Actionable fix: add a short section (2\u20133 paragraphs) titled something like \"Key non\u2011ideal obstacles and heuristics to handle them.\" Give concrete heuristics (e.g. pilot trials, conditional funding, verification metrics, portfolio diversification, prioritise robust interventions over fragile high\u2011variance bets) and one quick example of how the ideal schema can be adapted in practice (e.g., how to fund and monitor a health NGO with uncertain capacity). Replace or heavily qualify language that claims the schema \"guarantees\" optimality \u2014 change to \"guarantees in the idealized model\" and flag the major real\u2011world failure modes up front. Suggested refs to cite briefly: Elinor Ostrom on collective action, basic mechanism\u2011design ideas (incentives/verification), and EA literature on non\u2011ideal prioritisation/robustness.  \n\n2) Insufficient attention to epistemic and strategic problems in identifying cooperators and estimating marginal cost\u2011effectiveness. Problem: Step 1 assumes you can identify who is \"willing and able\" to cooperate and Step 2 assumes you can compute marginal cost\u2011effectiveness accurately. Both are highly uncertain in practice and open to manipulation (misreporting, mission drift, capacity overstatement). Actionable fix: explicitly acknowledge three classes of uncertainty (a) identification of cooperators, (b) measurement of cost\u2011effectiveness and diminishing returns, and (c) strategic behavior by actors with perverse incentives. For each, add one concrete mitigation: e.g. due diligence and phased funding for (a); Bayesian updating, sensitivity analysis and option value for (b); and contract design / third\u2011party audits / escrow mechanisms for (c). Add one short illustrative anecdote (real or hypothetical) where mis\u2011identifying a cooperator or misestimating CE led to bad outcomes, to make the risk vivid.  \n\n3) Weak engagement with moral pluralism, legitimacy and political constraints. Problem: the post treats \"do more good\" as unambiguously dominant and downplays non\u2011consequentialist values (rights, fairness, democratic legitimacy) and political pushback that often blocks implementation. This risks alienating readers who care about justice, agency, or legitimate process and overlooks important trade\u2011offs between marginal interventions and systemic change. Actionable fix: add a brief paragraph acknowledging that consequentialist aggregation is contestable and describe two ways EA can respond: (i) justify consequentialist prioritisation instrumentally (e.g. it tends to reduce suffering fastest) or (ii) show how to incorporate pluralist constraints into the prioritisation algorithm (e.g. add floor constraints for rights, distributional weights, or a separate bucket for systemic/political work). Soften absolutist lines (like \"no other moral goals can compete\") or immediately follow them with caveats and options for pluralist readers.  \n\nMinor tone suggestion: trim hyperbolic claims/jokes (\"moral philosophy was solved in 1980\", \"Who could want that?\") or mark them clearly as tongue\u2011in\u2011cheek \u2014 they weaken credibility for readers unfamiliar with your voice. Overall: the piece makes a clear and useful conceptual case, but adding compact, concrete content on non\u2011ideal implementation, uncertainty/strategic risks, and moral pluralism would prevent common misunderstandings and increase the post's practical usefulness.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback correctly identifies the author's biggest vulnerabilities: leaning on ideal theory while claiming guarantees, underestimating epistemic/strategic friction in finding cooperators and estimating marginal CE, and brushing aside pluralist or political objections. Each point is actionable (concise non\u2011ideal heuristics, concrete mitigations, brief pluralism caveat) and can be added without bloating the post, so adopting it would substantially reduce embarrassing 'own goals' and improve practical usefulness."

    "post_id": "a2j8K49AMyFLKLXcE",
    "clarity_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The post is generally well structured and argues its point coherently: it presents a clear two-step schema, explains prioritization with marginal-cost reasoning, and anticipates common objections. For an EA/philosophy-literate audience it is easy to follow. Weaknesses are density and verbosity (long sentences, many parenthetical asides and footnotes), reliance on jargon and linked references that interrupt the flow, and few concrete, simple examples for newcomers. Trimming digressions and simplifying language would make it clearer to a broader readership."

    "novelty_humanity": 4,
    "explanation": "Most of the post restates longstanding EA and consequentialist ideas (cause\u2011neutrality, marginal cost\u2011effectiveness, prioritization, diminishing returns, coordination to solve collective action problems) that EA readers will already know, so it is not novel to that audience. The only slightly less common elements are the explicitly framed two\u2011step cooperative schema (a restatement of cooperative utilitarianism) and some emphases \u2014 e.g. the formalized marginal allocation procedure and the \u2018EA minimizes abandonment\u2019 rebuttal \u2014 which might be mildly new to a general audience but are still fairly intuitive and have been circulated before. Overall the piece synthesizes familiar concepts rather than introducing fundamentally new claims."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The piece presents a clear, internally coherent philosophical argument for cause\u2011neutral consequentialist prioritization, gives a simple two\u2011step schema and explains diminishing marginal returns and temporary prioritization; it acknowledges idealization and some limits. Weaknesses: It relies heavily on ideal theory and simplistic assumptions (accurate cost\u2011effectiveness estimates, easy identification of competent cooperators, negligible coordination/strategic/institutional costs), overlooks many real\u2011world issues (measurement error, political feasibility, perverse incentives, distributional/justice concerns, moral uncertainty beyond 'buckets'), and provides almost no empirical evidence or case studies to support practical effectiveness. Overall: plausible in principle but under\u2011supported for strong practical claims."

    "validation_notes": "Most of the post\u2019s empirical claims are verifiable and mostly accurate, but the piece is primarily philosophical/speculative so many claims are normative rather than strictly empirical. Verified: (a) EA has attracted hundreds of millions in funding and influential evaluators (GiveWell / Open Philanthropy numbers); (b) the EA community is small relative to the world (thousands\u2013tens of thousands engaged; ~3,567 completed the 2022 EA Survey; CEA lists a few hundred active groups); (c) criticisms and PR problems (including high-profile controversies) are documented in mainstream press. A specific phrasing the author recalls \u2014 someone at EA Global saying EA was \u201cthe last social movement the world would ever need\u201d \u2014 could not be located in reliable media archives and appears to be an imprecise memory or paraphrase; I could not find a primary-source report of that exact quote. Other claims that are philosophical (e.g., \u201cgiven enough talent and resources EA would solve all solvable problems\u201d) are argumentative/speculative and not empirically testable. Overall: most concrete empirical statements (movement size, funding, Oxfam quote/objection, \u2018room for more funding\u2019 / diminishing marginal returns) are supported by public sources, but some rhetorical/historical details are unverified and several claims are normative rather than empirical.",
