    "explanation": "This is a practical, community\u2011level solicitation to identify high-skill users of LLMs. It can help diffuse useful tactics and raise productivity within EA/x-risk orgs, but it isn\u2019t foundational to core EA theories or strategies. Whether the specific people named are right or wrong has limited systemic consequences; the post is useful operationally but not critical for major decisions or humanity-wide outcomes."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Define scope and success metrics \u2014 right now the ask (\u2018who are the best people using LLMs for productivity?\u2019) and the implied goal (make EA/x-risk projects more productive with AI) are too vague. Actionable fixes: say which kinds of work you care about (research, policy, ops, fundraising, recruiting), define what \u201cbest\u201d means (speedup, quality, reproducibility, cost-savings), and include concrete metrics you\u2019ll use to compare people (e.g., % time saved, number of high-quality outputs produced per week, error rate). Don\u2019t treat the Forethought 30% figure as a direct prescription without explaining how it maps to your scope or how you\u2019ll prioritize use-cases.\n\n2) Make your methodology explicit and address selection bias \u2014 interviewing a few standout operators can teach useful tricks but may not produce scalable practices. Actionable fixes: say how you\u2019ll identify candidates (criteria, nomination vs open call), commit to a structured method (standard interview guide, demo tasks, artifacts requested), and explain how you\u2019ll evaluate generalizability (pilot a template in 2\u20133 orgs or roles). This prevents the post from reading like a hunt for celebrity practitioners and makes the output useful to others.\n\n3) Anticipate ethical, IP and scalability constraints \u2014 extracting people\u2019s \u201csecrets\u201d has practical and ethical pitfalls and many productivity wins depend on org-level changes not just individual skill. Actionable fixes: state how you\u2019ll handle proprietary workflows and consent (anonymize, get permission to share templates), consider organizational barriers (incentives, tooling, security) that block adoption, and outline plans to package learnings into reproducible artefacts (checklists, prompt templates, training modules) rather than person-specific tips.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback catches several important weaknesses: the post is vague about scope and success metrics, risks cherry-picking standout individuals without assessing generalizability, and naively promises to extract \u2018secrets\u2019 without addressing consent/IP or organizational constraints. These are actionable, high-impact fixes that would substantially improve the post without forcing a major rewrite. Not fatal to the idea, but without them the post reads underspecified and potentially irresponsible."

    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The post is easy to understand: it states a problem (AI deployment as a bottleneck), cites a source, and explains the author's plan (interviewing people who use AI well). The motivation and intended action are clear and concise. It could be improved by explicitly stating the ask (e.g., request for names, examples, or criteria) and by giving a bit more detail on what counts as 'using AI well' to make responses more targeted."

    "explanation": "The post mainly asks for names/examples of people who are effective LLM users and plans to learn from them. Within the EA/longtermist community this is very familiar territory (many discussions already cover AI tool adoption, playbooks, and productivity \u2018power users\u2019), so it\u2019s not very novel. To the general public it\u2019s slightly more novel because systematic extraction of community-specific LLM best-practices is less widespread, but the core idea\u2014identify and learn from power users of a new technology\u2014is still common."

    "reasoning_quality": 5,
    "evidence_quality": 3,
    "overall_support": 4,
    "explanation": "The post makes a plausible and internally consistent claim \u2014 that deploying AI tools could become a bottleneck and that learning from high-performing practitioners is a useful next step \u2014 but it is exploratory rather than argumentative. It leans on a single external estimate (Forethought) and mostly anecdotal intuition, provides no empirical measures of the bottleneck or of productivity gains, and offers no methodology for identifying or generalising lessons from 'best' users. To strengthen the case it would need broader empirical support, outcome metrics, and a clearer plan to avoid selection and survivorship biases."

    "validation_notes": "The post's central empirical claim \u2014 \u201cLizka and Owen at Forethought estimate ~30% of the x-risk community should focus on applying AI tools\u201d \u2014 is accurately reported and verifiable on Forethought\u2019s writeup \u201cAI Tools for Existential Security\u201d (released 14 Mar 2025). However, that 30% figure is presented there as a normative recommendation by the authors (an expert judgment), not as a data-driven empirical estimate, so it should be treated as an informed opinion rather than an objective measurement. Other statements in the post are subjective or anecdotal (e.g., \u2018AI could become a deployment bottleneck\u2019 and \u2018some people in the community are already using AI\u2019). The latter is supported by multiple EA Forum threads and community discussions showing active LLM use for productivity. Overall: well-supported reporting of Forethought\u2019s recommendation, but limited empirical grounding beyond expert opinion and community anecdotes \u2014 hence a score of 8.",
