    "explanation": "This draft addresses a core technical result in population ethics (Arrhenius's impossibility theorem) that is directly relevant to EA concerns about how to aggregate welfare across populations and time. If the loopholes are sound and lead to plausible new welfarist axiologies, that could materially affect longtermist reasoning and modeling, so the idea is moderately important to the EA/rationalist community. However, the post is a graduate-level, preliminary presentation of technical points: it is speculative, narrow, and unlikely to directly change policy or public views unless developed, peer-reviewed, and adopted widely\u2014so its importance to general humanity is minor."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Be explicit and rigorous about exactly which axiom(s) or step(s) of Arrhenius\u2019s proof you are targeting. Right now you say there are \u201ctwo loopholes\u201d but don\u2019t give the formal definitions or point to the precise lemma/line of the proof you exploit. Actionable: in the post (or an appendix) state Arrhenius\u2019s axioms you rely on verbatim, show which assumption you weaken or reinterpret, and give a full, self-contained counterexample or revised proof sketch that a competent reader can check without chasing citations. This avoids the appearance that the loopholes are just handwaving or reliant on trivial domain restrictions. \n\n2) Defend the normative plausibility of the changes you propose. Many EA readers will dismiss any \u201cloophole\u201d that is achieved only by abandoning intuitively central axioms (e.g. Pareto, anonymity, continuity) or by imposing highly non\u2011transparent technical moves. Actionable: for each axiom you weaken or remove, give a short, concrete argument for why that move is normatively acceptable (or at least worth taking), and show the substantive ethical consequences (e.g. how your proposal treats the Repugnant Conclusion, tradeoffs between quantity/quality, policy-relevant outcomes). If the loophole produces bizarre or counterintuitive implications, acknowledge them and explain why they\u2019re tolerable or how they can be avoided.\n\n3) Situate the claim with respect to prior work and obvious rejoinders. There\u2019s a well-developed literature on responses to Arrhenius and related impossibility results; a reader will expect you to show how your loopholes are novel and not already refuted. Actionable: add targeted literature citations (Arrhenius follow-ups, major critiques and defenses, and examples of axiologies that try similar moves), summarize expected counterarguments (e.g. that you\u2019re just restricting the population domain, smuggling in comparability assumptions, or relying on non-measurable utilities), and give concise responses. Even a short paragraph saying \u201cwhy this is new and survives the common replies\u201d will materially increase credibility.",
    "improvement_potential": "Very useful. The feedback points out major methodological and rhetorical gaps \u2014 lack of precise formal targets in Arrhenius\u2019s proof, no defense of the normative acceptability of the weakened axioms, and no engagement with prior literature or standard rejoinders. Fixing these would materially increase credibility and prevent the paper from seeming like handwaving; they are critical improvements the author should make, though they won\u2019t necessarily prove the thesis wrong if left unaddressed."

    "explanation": "No evidence of a widely-known EA/rationalist author named 'wallower' in public sources up to mid\u20112024. Likely a pseudonymous or very low\u2011profile writer with minimal presence in EA circles or broader public discourse."

    "post_id": "CZqKmrpnBJGPdCExX",
    "clarity_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The post is easy to understand in intent and context: it clearly states the paper title, purpose (two loopholes in Arrhenius's theorem), venue, and provides relevant links. However, it does not summarize the loopholes, methods, or main conclusions, so it makes no substantive argument here \u2014 readers must follow the links or read the draft to evaluate the claim. The tone is concise and appropriate for a short draft-announcement, but slightly too brief to be persuasive on its own; a one-paragraph abstract of the loopholes would improve argument clarity."

    "novelty_humanity": 9,
    "explanation": "For an EA/longtermist audience the topic (Arrhenius's impossibility theorem and attempts to evade it) is well known, so the post is moderately novel \u2014 it may present original technical moves (two specific 'loopholes') that specialists will find interesting, but the general research agenda and many related critiques already exist. For the general public this is highly novel: formal population\u2011ethics impossibility results and technical strategies to avoid them are obscure and unlikely to have been considered outside philosophy and EA circles."

    "reasoning_quality": 3,

    "overall_support": 3,
    "explanation": "The post itself contains almost no substantive argumentation or evidence \u2014 it is a short announcement that a draft and conference presentation exist and claims two \"loopholes\" in Arrhenius's impossibility proof. That gives very limited basis to assess logical soundness. The one positive is that the work has been accepted to a graduate conference and links to related PhilPapers entries are provided, which suggest the author is engaging relevant literature. However, no statements of the axioms changed, no formal proofs or sketches, no examples, and no comparison to existing critiques are included here. For those reasons the reasoning cannot be judged as robust, and empirical/formal evidence is effectively absent. To be better supported the post would need clear presentation of the two loopholes, formal argumentation or counterexamples, and discussion of consequences and tradeoffs relative to Arrhenius's assumptions."

Gustaf Arrhenius\u2019s 2000 impossibility theorem for welfarist axiologies is an established, peer\u2011reviewed result (Economics & Philosophy/Cambridge). The draft paper referenced (Walter Barta, \u201cSome Potential Loopholes\u2026\u201d) appears on PhilPapers/PhilArchive and matches the post\u2019s description. The Annual Southwest (Southwest) Graduate Philosophy Conference 2025 program at ASU lists a talk with the same (or nearly identical) title by Walter Barta, supporting the claim that the work was accepted to that conference. Minor issues: the EA Forum poster\u2019s username (\u201cwallower\u201d) differs from the paper\u2019s named author (Walter Barta), and the PhilPapers entries are drafts (PhilArchive) rather than a finalized journal publication \u2014 both are explainable and do not undermine the post\u2019s core factual claims. No strong contradictory evidence was found.",
