    "explanation": "This post raises a real but narrow concern: the idea that individual writing might shape future AGI through training data is relevant to AI governance and strategy discussions, but the post itself is a short, personal query rather than a developed argument or evidence. If the core worry is correct it modestly affects how some community members might act (what they publish, whether they try to influence training distributions), but it isn't foundational to longtermist or safety theory and individual contributions are small relative to the massive, diverse datasets and institutional actors that actually determine model behavior. For the broader public the impact is minor \u2014 interesting but not consequential for most human decisions."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Clarify your objective and explicit assumptions. Right now you ask how to be \u201cvisible to the AIs\u201d without defining what \"influence AGI\" means (short vs long timeframe, narrow models vs general AGI), how you think content would reach an AGI (web crawl, curated corpora, private datasets), or what kinds of influence you want (values, capabilities, priorities). Actionable fix: add a short paragraph that states your goal and the concrete causal chain you assume (I want my writing to be included in training data via public web crawling -> that will change model behaviour in X way -> that affects AGI outcomes). Cite or acknowledge uncertainty about those steps.\n\n2) Provide evidence and consider trade\u2011offs/risks you\u2019ve overlooked. The post treats \"write more so AIs train on you\" as obviously good, but you haven\u2019t shown (or asked for) evidence that most training data actually comes from the places you post, nor that marginal content from one author will meaningfully steer models. You also ignore clear counterarguments: publishing can leak tactics or sensitive info, make you a target, or be legally/licensing-constrained. Actionable fix: ask for or link to empirical sources on dataset composition and training practices (papers or model datasheets), and add a short paragraph acknowledging risks and tradeoffs you\u2019re willing to accept.\n\n3) Replace vague requests with concrete, safer tactics readers can evaluate. Rather than a generic plea to \u201cbe more visible,\u201d give (or ask for) specific channels and practices that match different goals: e.g. to increase chance of inclusion use public, crawlable repositories (personal blog, GitHub, arXiv) and explicit permissive licensing; to influence values write clear, high\u2011quality, citable essays or peer\u2011reviewed pieces; to influence governance prioritize engagement with researchers and policymakers or contributing to curated datasets and model audits. Also recommend redacting or abstracting sensitive details. Actionable fix: narrow the question in the post to 1\u20132 concrete routes you\u2019re willing to pursue and ask the community for experience or critiques of those specific tactics.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback correctly flags the post\u2019s biggest weaknesses: it\u2019s vague about what \u2018influence AGI\u2019 means and the causal chain to get there, it assumes publishing is beneficial without evidence, and it fails to note real risks and concrete tactics. Fixing those points would materially improve the post (greater clarity, testable assumptions, and safer, actionable options) without needing lots of extra length. A minor caveat: some suggestions are obvious to experienced readers, but overall the feedback identifies important mistakes the author should address."

    "explanation": "The post is short, direct, and easy to understand \u2014 it clearly expresses a worry about producing content that could influence future AIs and asks for others' experience and tips. However, it lacks specificity (what kind of \"influence\" is meant, which AIs or training pipelines, what \"visible to the AIs\" entails) and the title is slightly broader than the body, which reduces argumentative precision. With a bit more context and concrete questions it would be clearer and more actionable."

    "explanation": "EA Forum readers and the AI-safety/longtermist community have frequently discussed how public content shapes models (and whether to produce, curate, or game training data), so the core worries and tactics here are not new to that audience. For the general educated public the idea is somewhat less familiar \u2014 the specific tradeoff of \u2018write more to influence AGI\u2019 vs \u2018withhold content to avoid training\u2019 and asking for tactics is moderately novel but has appeared increasingly in media and public discussion, so it isn\u2019t highly original."

    "explanation": "The post mainly expresses a personal reaction and poses questions rather than making a developed argument. Its central intuition\u2014that publicly produced writing can shape future AI models\u2014is plausible, but the post provides no structured reasoning (no causal chain, scope, or mechanism) and relies on anecdote and an appeal to authority (Tyler Cowen). There is no empirical evidence, citations, or analysis of how training data is collected, filtered, or weighted, so claims about impact and how to increase visibility are unsupported. The question is reasonable to raise, but as presented the support for any concrete thesis is weak."

    "validation_notes": "Key empirical claims in the post are mostly supported. Tyler Cowen did explicitly say he\u2019s \u201cwriting for the AIs\u201d and urged others to do so (podcast transcript). Major LLM developers confirm models are trained on publicly available internet text plus licensed and human\u2011provided data, so new public writing can enter training pools. Academic work shows models can memorize and sometimes reproduce training examples (so contributions can influence model outputs), and industry analyses (Epoch AI, press coverage) flag public human\u2011written data as a potential bottleneck \u2014 all of which make the author's worry plausible. However, how much influence a single author\u2019s output will have on future AGI behaviour is uncertain: training pipelines are huge, often proprietary, filtered/deduplicated, and firms license paywalled content; influence typically requires either high volume/uniqueness or targeted attacks. Thus claims are well supported for plausibility but speculative about magnitude/effect on \u201cAGI.\u201d",
