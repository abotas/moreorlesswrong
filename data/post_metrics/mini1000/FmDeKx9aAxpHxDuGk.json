    "explanation": "This is a practical, empathetic, and potentially life\u2011saving post for people in crisis and for the EA community specifically. It normalizes help\u2011seeking, provides concrete resources (including EA\u2011friendly therapist listings), and addresses a real, recurring problem in the community; while not foundational to EA\u2019s philosophical or technical claims, it is highly load\u2011bearing for community welfare, retention, and humane norms. For general humanity the content is valuable and could save lives for readers, but it is one of many similar suicide\u2011prevention messages and therefore has moderate rather than systemic impact."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Missing immediate-safety guidance and forum-safety best practices \u2014 The post gives good general encouragement and hotline links, but it should also include explicit, concrete instructions for people in imminent danger (e.g., \u201cIf you are in immediate danger, call emergency services/911 or go to your nearest emergency room,\u201d advise removing/limiting access to means, and suggest asking someone to stay with you). Also ensure the post follows suicide-posting best practices (content warning, avoid graphic detail, avoid glamorizing or making suicide sound normative or inevitable). Action: add a brief crisis-action block at the top or immediately after the TL;DR with those steps and a short content warning.  \n\n2) Two-sizes-fits-all phrasing that can feel invalidating or simplistic \u2014 Lines like \u201cthere are two kinds of people\u2026\u201d and \u201csuicide is a permanent solution to a temporary situation\u201d are pithy but risk alienating readers (especially those with chronic illness, persistent suicidality, or those who\u2019ve tried many interventions). They also oversimplify complex social and clinical realities. Action: soften or remove the binary language and qualify the \u201ctemporary\u201d claim (e.g., acknowledge chronic pain/illness and say recovery is often non-linear; emphasize validation and that help can still reduce suffering even when it\u2019s long-standing).  \n\n3) Potential conflict-of-interest / vetting transparency for resources \u2014 You link MentNav and a Google doc of therapists who \u201cunderstand EA values.\u201d If you have any affiliation with MentNav or the linked list, disclose it. Also briefly state the selection/quality criteria for those resources (or add mainstream alternatives like national professional directories) so readers know why they might choose them. Action: add a one-sentence disclosure and a line about how you picked those resources or offer other widely used directories for readers in different countries.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback targets important, non-trivial omissions and tone issues that could materially reduce the post's safety and accessibility: adding immediate-safety actions and forum best-practices is essential for suicide-related posts; softening binary/Platonic language reduces risk of alienating people with chronic issues; and disclosing affiliations/selection criteria for resources increases trust. These changes are high-impact and relatively short to implement, so addressing them would substantially improve the post without undue lengthening."

    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "Overall very clear: a direct TL;DR, empathetic tone, well-structured personal testimony, practical next steps (hotlines, journaling, therapy, try again), and relevant links. The argument that reaching out helps is compelling and consistently supported by personal and professional experience. Minor weaknesses: occasional repetition and a few absolute phrasings (e.g., \"two kinds of people\") that could be softened, and some EA-specific references that might slightly reduce accessibility for non-EA readers. Length is appropriate for the subject, though a few paragraphs could be tightened for greater concision."

    "explanation": "The core messages (if you\u2019re suicidal, reach out; crisis lines help; you\u2019re not a burden; therapy, journaling, support groups can help) are very familiar. For EA readers the post has a bit of novelty in its EA-specific framing and resources (MentNav, tying the plea to longtermist values, mention of Marisa) and the author\u2019s dual perspective as a survivor and crisis counselor, but the main claims and advice are not original."

    "explanation": "Strengths: clear, coherent, compassionate argument grounded in the author's lived experience and crisis-counseling background; practical, actionable advice (hotlines, journaling, therapy, persistence) and useful reassurance. Weaknesses: empirical claims (e.g. \u201cIt works\u201d) rest on anecdote and profession-based authority rather than cited studies; no discussion of limits, heterogeneity of outcomes, or emergency protocols; missing rigorous evidence for long-term effectiveness. Overall the post offers well-structured, credible practical guidance but provides weak empirical support within the text."

    "validation_notes": "Most of the post's main empirical claims are supported by reputable evidence but important nuances are missing. Facts: the U.S. 988 lifeline exists (launched July 2022) and crisis lines are staffed to help. Research shows crisis calls produce immediate reductions in distress and suicidal feelings (proximal benefits) and training improves in-call outcomes; however, systematic reviews judge the overall long-term evidence (reduced future attempts/completed suicide) to be low-quality or mixed. Recommendations that journaling/expressive writing and psychotherapy can help (including reducing alexithymia) are supported by meta-analyses but effect sizes are often small-to-moderate. The broad protective role of social connectedness is well established. The author\u2019s clinical/reassuring assertions (\u201cyou are not a burden\u201d, \u201ctalking works\u201d) are empirically defensible in the short-term and as public-health advice, but claims implying robust long-term prevention of suicide from a single call or single intervention are not fully supported by high-quality evidence.",
