    "explanation": "This is a practical, potentially helpful tool for people in FIRE/EA who need to model tradeoffs between work, spending, and giving. If widely adopted by EAs it could modestly increase donation commitments, enable career changes toward higher-impact work, and improve planning confidence \u2014 so it\u2019s moderately useful to the community but not foundational to EA arguments or strategy. For general humanity the effect is small: it\u2019s a niche personal-finance planning tool that can help some individuals gain security or give more, but has limited systemic impact. Main caveats are reach (few people will use it) and risks from oversimplified modeling or misuse."

    "robustness_score": 3,
    "actionable_feedback": "1) Make the model assumptions explicit and easy to inspect. EA readers will want to know the core modeling choices (nominal vs real returns, assumed average return and volatility, inflation, tax treatment, withdrawal rate, salary growth, contribution timing, employer match, how CoastFI is calculated, and whether sequence-of-returns risk is captured). Either expose the formulas on the page, publish the spreadsheet/logic (or code) openly, or add a concise methodology appendix. Also include a simple sensitivity table or toggle (e.g., conservative / base / optimistic) so users see how fragile the outputs are to plausible parameter changes.\n\n2) Handle\u2014or clearly flag\u2014important omissions and edge cases. The post/tool currently reads as if the world is a single, simple savings/investment account. Call out and ideally allow for: taxes, employer matches/vesting schedules, equity compensation, debt, housing (home equity, mortgage), pensions/Social Security, partner finances, and insurance/healthcare costs. Most importantly, add a warning and simple modelling option for sequence-of-returns risk if people plan to FIRE early (this is a common real-world failure mode). If you can\u2019t model these now, state the limitation plainly and give guidance on when users should consult a financial planner.\n\n3) Add basic validation, privacy and usage notes to avoid credibility/ethical pitfalls. The use-case anecdotes are fine but don\u2019t substitute for validation \u2014 show 1\u20132 worked examples (inputs \u2192 calculations \u2192 outputs) and/or comparisons to established FI calculators so readers can sanity-check results. Also clarify data handling: will inputs be stored, shared, or emailed when the tool is served via the form? State a short privacy notice and keep the tool free/open where possible. Finally, soften prescriptive language about life choices (avoid implying the tool gives definitive answers) and invite explicit feedback channels for bugs and edge cases.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback targets core, high-impact weaknesses: lack of explicit model assumptions, missing treatment of common real-world factors (taxes, equity comp, debt, pensions, sequence-of-returns risk), no validation examples, and unclear privacy/usage handling. Fixing these would substantially reduce the risk of misleading users and improve credibility without fundamentally changing the tool\u2019s purpose. It\u2019s not rated a 10 because these are correctable issues rather than fatal flaws\u2014the tool\u2019s basic idea stands\u2014but they are critical for quality and trustworthiness and should be addressed before wide use."

    "explanation": "No notable presence in Effective Altruism/rationalist communities (not a known contributor or speaker). There is a public figure named Rebecca Herbst (an American TV actress best known for a long-running role on the soap 'General Hospital'), which gives modest recognition among soap audiences but not broad global prominence as an author or public intellectual. If this is a different person using the same name or a pseudonym, provide more context and I can reassess."

    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "Overall clear and well-structured: strong summary, rationale, feature list, worked examples, tips, and author background make the post easy to follow and persuasive. Weaknesses: a bit repetitive and wordy in places, the temporary-access note is slightly confusing, and it lacks concise technical details (key assumptions, formulas, exact inputs/outputs and target audience) that would make the tool's claims more immediately verifiable."

    "novelty_ea": 3,
    "novelty_humanity": 4,
    "explanation": "For EA Forum readers this is low-novelty: the core concepts (FI calculators, CoastFI, scenario modelling, and donation pledges) are well-known within FIRE/EA circles and similar tools already exist. The main incremental elements are packaging, a concise single-screen UX, and making donation rate an explicit separate input tailored to EA-minded users \u2014 useful but not conceptually new. For the general public it's modestly more novel: many people have seen retirement/FI calculators but fewer have encountered CoastFI or a scenario tool that foregrounds charitable-giving tradeoffs. Still, the underlying ideas are common in personal-finance tools, so it\u2019s only moderately novel rather than highly original."

    "overall_support": 4,
    "explanation": "Strengths: The post is logically organized, the goals and intended use-cases are clear, and the argument that a simple interactive planner can help people visualize trade-offs and make decisions is plausible and consistent with common practice. The author\u2019s personal experience and community ties lend some credibility. Weaknesses: The claim that the tool produces meaningful changes in decisions or outcomes is supported only by anecdotal examples rather than systematic evidence. Crucial methodological details and assumptions (returns, inflation, taxes, uncertainty, sensitivity analysis) are not given, there are no user-testing results, no comparisons to alternative tools, and no data on real-world impacts. Overall this is a reasonably argued product announcement with low empirical support for its effectiveness as presented."

    "validation_notes": "Most empirical claims in the post are verifiable and accurate. Yield & Spread is an active nonprofit (website, blog, free tools) and the FI Purpose Planner and FI-lanthropy calculator are published on their site. Rebecca Herbst\u2019s EA Forum posts and profile corroborate her involvement in EA, her FI background, and promotion of these tools. The characterization of a typical \u201cFI number = 25x annual expenses\u201d correctly reflects the common 4%/25x rule used in FI discourse. CoastFI (Coast FIRE) is an established concept in the FIRE community. Weaknesses: a specific YouTube talk ID referenced in the post (RqHYea7yems) could not be located, so that precise citation of an EAGx talk couldn\u2019t be confirmed; example user stories in the post are anecdotal and not independently verifiable. Overall the factual claims about the tool, organization, author background, and standard FI concepts are well-supported by trustworthy public sources.",
