    "explanation": "This report advances a plausibly important, actionable thesis for the EA community: that exploration and prioritization often deserve a large (possibly majority) share of effort because opportunity returns are heavy\u2011tailed. If broadly true this would meaningfully change how EA (and related organisations) allocate funding, talent development, and research vs. direct work. However the analysis is theoretical, explicitly low\u2011confidence in many places, ignores several realistic effects (negative externalities, flow\u2011through benefits, mixed projects), and depends on strong distributional and identifiability assumptions. That makes it consequential and worth attention within EA (high importance for strategy and prioritization), but of only modest importance for general humanity given its niche scope and uncertain empirical backing."

    "explanation": "There is no well-known EA/rationalist figure widely recognized as 'Babel'. The name appears to be a pseudonym or a very minor/obscure author with limited or niche presence (if any) on community forums; essentially no mainstream or global public recognition. If you have a link or more context (where they publish, sample work), I can reassess."

    "clarity_score": 7,
    "explanation": "Generally clear and well-structured for an EA/research audience: it opens with epistemic status, lays out numbered claims with confidence estimates, and lists limitations and practical implications. Strengths include logical organization, explicit caveats, and concrete claim labels. Weaknesses are formatting problems (broken image/placeholders like \"![]()\"), heavy reliance on dense footnotes and technical jargon, and occasional long/complex sentences that make it harder for non-experts to follow; the many caveats also dilute the main argumentative thrust. Overall readable with some effort for informed readers, but could be tightened and fixed for broader clarity."

    "explanation": "For EA readers the high-level ideas (exploration vs exploitation, heavy-tailed impact, value of prioritization/cause prioritization) are familiar, and there is prior discussion using bandit/VOI intuition. What is moderately novel here is the specific, formalized argument and quantitative heuristics: claims like spending >50% effort on exploration in many cases, the model that treating each evaluation task as roughly as important as the eventual best project, and the application of Pareto-style heavy-tail assumptions to per-project TOC distributions. For the general public these claims and the formal framing are considerably more original \u2014 most non\u2011specialists haven't seen these ideas applied concretely to altruistic resource allocation or exposed to the particular heuristics and model-driven prescriptions in this post."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post is well-structured, transparent about assumptions and uncertainties, presents a coherent theoretical model, distinguishes cases (e.g. correlated vs uncorrelated projects), and gives useful heuristics and confidence estimates. Weaknesses: Key conclusions rest on strong, contestable assumptions (power-law/Pareto heavy tails, ability to identify ex-post best projects, ignoring negative impacts/externalities and diminishing returns), plus difficulties like Pascal\u2019s-wager-type infinities that are not resolved. Empirical support is thin \u2014 largely qualitative argumentation and a few illustrative examples rather than systematic data or robust validation \u2014 so the main thesis is plausible but only weak-to-moderately supported in practice."

Several of the post\u2019s concrete empirical claims are verifiable and supported (e.g. the GPT\u20113 Table D.1 compute breakdown implying ~12% of compute was used on smaller models; community estimates that ~9% of EA organizations\u2019 prioritization effort is in cause\u2011level prioritization). The post\u2019s broader empirical premises \u2014 that opportunity/impact distributions are heavy\u2011tailed and that exploration/prioritization should often dominate direct work \u2014 are plausible and supported by literature showing heavy tails in citations, scientific impact and venture returns, but important caveats apply: (a) empirical work shows heavy tails are common but not universal and many datasets fit log\u2011normal or truncated power laws better than a pure Pareto; (b) whether >50% of effort should go to exploration is model\u2011dependent (exploration/exploitation tradeoffs are governed by horizon, noise, correlation and other parameters per bandit theory) and the author already flags low confidence. Overall: specific factual claims cited by the author mostly check out; stronger normative/theoretical prescriptions are plausible but not empirically established and depend on strong modeling assumptions.",

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Central dependence on a power\u2011law / heavy\u2011tailed world is under\u2011analyzed and under\u2011tested. Your main policy recommendation (spend >50% on E&P) follows mostly from heavy tails. You already note the log\u2011normal alternative, but before publishing you should (a) add a short robustness / sensitivity section showing how the optimal E&P share moves as you vary key distributional parameters (e.g. Pareto alpha, or log\u2011normal variance) and report threshold values where the recommendation flips, and (b) add at least one empirical check or citation that plausibly supports heavy tails for EA\u2011relevant opportunities (grants, cause breakthroughs, career impacts, tech adoption). Readers will reasonably want numbers (e.g. if alpha> X then E&P share >50%) rather than qualitative statements.  Actionable changes: include 2\u20133 plots or a small table with parameter sweeps and a paragraph summarizing empirical evidence or admitting the lack of it and how that affects confidence.\n\n2) The assumption that exploration/prioritization can identify the ex\u2011post best project (or that evaluations are costless/accurate) is unrealistically strong and drives large conclusions. You should relax this: model noisy/partial identification (probability of correct ranking p, or signal\u2011to\u2011noise ratio), per\u2011project evaluation costs, and diminishing returns to evaluation effort, then show how optimal allocation depends on p and cost. If adding math would bloat the post, at minimum state clearly (a) how conclusions change when identification is imperfect, (b) realistic ranges for p and costs in EA contexts, and (c) recommend practical heuristics (e.g. stop searching after marginal EV of another evaluation < expected impact of direct work).  Actionable changes: add a short subsection with a toy numeric example (two or three p/cases) that demonstrates the qualitative change when identification is noisy.\n\n3) Important social / structural factors are glossed over: externalities, public\u2011good nature of E&P, mixing of E&P and direct work within projects, non\u2011TOC/negative impacts, and scalability/diminishing returns. These factors often reverse or materially alter prescriptions about who should do E&P (individual vs community), how to coordinate, and whether to centralize prioritization. Before publishing, either (a) include a concise decision framed checklist that tells readers when the paper\u2019s recommendations apply (e.g. when information is private, small team, low externalities, TOC dominates), or (b) add a brief paragraph per omitted factor explaining direction and magnitude of likely effect on your main claims and concrete mitigations (e.g. share findings publicly to internalize positive externalities; prefer centralized/collective E&P for public goods; explicitly model negative\u2011impact tails / Pascal\u2011type risks).  Actionable changes: add a 300\u2013500 word \u201cwhen this DOESN\u2019T apply\u201d box with concrete community recommendations (coordination, open publication, avoidance of duplicated E&P, and accounting for negative tails).",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback identifies the report\u2019s largest potential weaknesses: heavy reliance on a power\u2011law assumption, the unrealistic perfect\u2011identification/evaluation assumption, and neglected social/externality factors. It gives concrete, actionable fixes (sensitivity sweeps, toy numeric examples, and a short \u2018\u2018when this doesn\u2019t apply\u2019\u2019 checklist) that would substantially reduce the risk of embarrassing overclaims without forcing a long rewrite. Addressing these would materially improve the report\u2019s credibility and practical usefulness; it\u2019s not a fatal critique (the author already flags some limits), but it corrects core vulnerabilities."
