    "explanation": "This is a practical, middle\u2011priority movement\u2011building proposal rather than a foundational EA or world\u2011shaping idea. If a well\u2011designed Animal Advocacy Corps worked as intended it could materially increase recruitment, identity formation, and in\u2011person collaboration in the animal advocacy movement \u2014 which would be useful to EAs focused on animal welfare and movement strategy. However, it\u2019s primarily an operational intervention with modest scale relative to highest\u2011priority EA causes (e.g., AI safety, global catastrophic risk), and many key questions (counterfactual recruitment, available host placements, cost\u2011effectiveness versus existing programs) are unresolved. For general humanity the direct effects would be limited: some gain in animal welfare and advocacy capacity, but not a high\u2011stakes or civilization\u2011level change. The idea is worth piloting/researching but is not load\u2011bearing for major EA worldviews or human welfare overall."
