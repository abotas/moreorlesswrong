    "explanation": "This is a practical, middle\u2011priority movement\u2011building proposal rather than a foundational EA or world\u2011shaping idea. If a well\u2011designed Animal Advocacy Corps worked as intended it could materially increase recruitment, identity formation, and in\u2011person collaboration in the animal advocacy movement \u2014 which would be useful to EAs focused on animal welfare and movement strategy. However, it\u2019s primarily an operational intervention with modest scale relative to highest\u2011priority EA causes (e.g., AI safety, global catastrophic risk), and many key questions (counterfactual recruitment, available host placements, cost\u2011effectiveness versus existing programs) are unresolved. For general humanity the direct effects would be limited: some gain in animal welfare and advocacy capacity, but not a high\u2011stakes or civilization\u2011level change. The idea is worth piloting/researching but is not load\u2011bearing for major EA worldviews or human welfare overall."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Weak / missing theory of change and measurable counterfactuals. The post assumes in-person placements will produce durable movement engagement, but doesn\u2019t define the primary outcomes, effect sizes, or how success would be measured. Actionable fix: add a concise theory of change (inputs\u2192activities\u2192short/medium/long outcomes) and at least one clear, feasible metric (e.g., % of cohort still working in or donating to the movement after 3 years; cost per retained advocate). Describe how you would test this (pilot with control/comparison group, pre/post surveys, long-term tracking) and what minimum effect would justify scaling. This will help readers judge whether the idea is worth pursuing and what research to prioritize. \n\n2) Insufficient engagement with counterfactuals and existing models. The post acknowledges similar programs but doesn\u2019t compare expected costs, scale, or marginal benefits to alternatives (remote fellowships, paid internships, targeted hiring, student-to-staff funnels). Actionable fix: include a short evidence/benchmark section\u2014summarize what Reducetarian, New Roots, Peace Corps, and Animal Advocacy Careers actually deliver (cost per participant, retention where available), and outline why an AAC would be meaningfully different. Run a simple counterfactual checklist: who would enter AAC who otherwise wouldn\u2019t; what would they do instead; could a cheaper remote/hybrid model capture most of the benefit? Suggest concrete next research steps: interviews with 10 current/former fellows and 10 hiring orgs to estimate demand and counterfactual trajectories, plus a back-of-envelope cost-effectiveness comparison. \n\n3) Overlooked operational, legal, equity and harm risks. The post glosses over practical barriers (visa/immigration, insurance, stipends that could be exploitative, supervision/quality of internships, safety, local harm or cultural insensitivity) and equity concerns (excludes people with caregiving needs, those who can\u2019t relocate). Actionable fix: add a short risks & mitigations section. At minimum: list the main operational constraints you\u2019d need to resolve before pilot (legal/HR, partner org capacity to host & supervise, stipend level needed for equitable participation), propose partners/venues for a small MVP (single city or region to reduce complexity), and commit to ethics/monitoring (host standards, grievance process, onboarding/training). Address inclusion explicitly\u2014why one-year in-person is or isn\u2019t appropriate for underrepresented groups, and possible hybrid alternatives. \n\nImplementing these three fixes will make the post far more actionable and reduce the chance of \u201cfounder\u2019s error\u201d (assuming a high-impact model without clear testing, counterfactuals, or operational planning).",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback identifies the key, non-trivial gaps in the post\u2014no clear theory of change or measurable outcomes, insufficient counterfactual/benchmarking against existing programs, and missing operational/legal/equity risk assessment. These are exactly the kinds of \u2018own-goal\u2019 omissions that make it hard to judge whether the idea is worth pursuing and would be embarrassing to miss once fundraising or piloting starts. The suggested fixes are concrete and actionable and would substantially improve the post without requiring an unwieldy expansion."

    "explanation": "The post is well-structured and easy to follow (clear sections: summary, problem, proposed solution, example, next steps, uncertainties) and makes a compelling, concrete proposal with a clear ask (feedback and potential founders). Minor weaknesses: occasional verbosity and hedging, some repetition, and a lack of compact evidence/data or success metrics which would strengthen the argument and make the call to action more specific. Tightening wording and explicitly listing the most important questions the author wants answered would make it a 9+."

    "novelty_ea": 3,
    "novelty_humanity": 5,
    "explanation": "For EA Forum readers this is fairly unoriginal: the basic idea (a fellowship/placement program for recent grads) and the goals (recruitment, identity-building, in\u2011person organizing) are well\u2011known within movement building and animal advocacy, and similar programs already exist (Reducetarian Fellowship, New Roots, Animal Advocacy Careers, plus analogues like Teach For America/Peace Corps). The most novel elements are the explicit Peace Corps framing (yearlong, rotating in\u2011person international placements) and the emphasis on using immersive placements specifically to rebuild in\u2011person movement culture \u2014 but these tweaks are incremental rather than groundbreaking. For the general educated public the idea is moderately novel: many people know of fellowships and Peace Corps\u2011style programs but are less likely to have considered applying that exact model to animal advocacy, especially with the articulated focus on identity formation and coordinated movement-building."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post lays out a clear, coherent problem-solution structure, identifies plausible mechanisms (identity formation, skills, in-person networks), compares to relevant analogues (Peace Corps, existing fellowships), and explicitly acknowledges key uncertainties and next steps. Weaknesses: It lacks a detailed theory of change, counterfactual analysis, scale estimates, or operational metrics; potential failure modes (cost, host capacity, selection effects) are only briefly noted. Empirical support is thin: primarily anecdote and analogy rather than data (no polling on post-graduation dropoff, no evidence that year-long in-person placements produce sustained movement engagement, no estimates of host demand or costs). Overall: an interesting and plausible hypothesis that is worth pilot-testing and research, but currently under-supported by evidence."

    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 7,
    "validation_notes": "Most of the concrete empirical claims in the post are verifiable and generally supported by public sources, but some of the author\u2019s causal or quantitative impressions (e.g., a large \u2018steep dropoff\u2019 in student activism specifically after graduation, or exactly how many in\u2011person partner organisations exist/would take interns) are plausible but lack direct, movement\u2011specific data. Strengths: the Peace Corps model exists and is accurately described; programs the author names (Reducetarian Fellowship, New Roots Institute, Animal Advocacy Careers, Fish Welfare Initiative) and the Hive Slack community exist and run in\u2011person or hybrid programs; there is independent evidence of substantial growth in funding/organizational capacity for farmed\u2011animal advocacy in the last decade. Weaknesses / uncertainties: the author\u2019s claims about a large post\u2011graduation engagement drop and a dominant shift to online organizing are plausible and partially supported by general volunteering / civic\u2011engagement statistics (younger adults volunteer at lower formal rates than some older cohorts), but there is little publicly available movement\u2011wide longitudinal data that quantifies the student\u2192adult dropoff in animal advocacy specifically. The author\u2019s call for more polling/data is correct \u2014 high\u2011quality, comprehensive datasets on movement engagement are limited. Overall: most factual, verifiable claims check out; normative/speculative claims are reasonable but under\u2011supported by direct data.",
