    "explanation": "The post challenges a common popular/economic story that people primarily care about relative income. If the claim were robustly true it would matter moderately: it would weaken happiness-based arguments for redistribution and change how subjective wellbeing is modelled, which has some downstream implications for policy design and cost\u2013benefit reasoning. However, the post is mostly rhetorical and rests on a simplified shortcut (ignoring migration costs, social ties, amenities, multi\u2011dimensional status signals, and reference groups), so it is not foundational. Many important EA conclusions (global poverty alleviation, longtermist priorities, AI safety) don\u2019t hinge on this point, and other ethical/political reasons to care about inequality remain. For general humanity the impact is nontrivial but limited \u2014 it might influence debate framing but would not upend major social or policy priorities on its own."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Overstates what the absence of migration to poorer areas implies (major causal inference error). You treat lack of observed moves as direct evidence people \u201cbarely care\u201d about relative income, but that ignores opportunity costs and constraints: jobs, schools, safety, public goods, social networks, stigma, mortgage costs, and legal/financial frictions. People may value relative status yet rationally decline to trade large absolute or non-pecuniary benefits to achieve a small boost in local rank. Actionable fix: temper the inference, explicitly model the tradeoffs, and either (a) reframe the claim as \u201cpeople rarely make *this particular* low-cost tradeoff\u201d rather than \u201cpeople barely care,\u201d or (b) show evidence that the cost of moving to a poorer area would be small for typical movers (and therefore the absence remains surprising).\u2028\n\n2) Mis-specifies reference groups and overlooks alternative mechanisms for status-seeking. The post assumes everyone\u2019s relevant comparison set is their immediate geographic neighbors. But many comparisons are nonlocal (colleagues, social media peers, hometown friends), and people may deliberately move to richer areas for positive spillovers (better networks, schools, job matches) rather than status per se. Also, status-seeking often shows up as conspicuous consumption, education choices, or residential sorting toward richer areas \u2014 patterns consistent with caring about relative position but for reasons other than simple local rank. Actionable fix: acknowledge heterogeneity in reference groups and plausible motives for moving to richer areas, and either limit the claim narrowly to local-neighbor comparisons or incorporate these alternative mechanisms into the argument.\n\n3) Relies on anecdote and thought experiments instead of engaging available empirical work and obvious counterfactual tests. You link Coate\u2019s piece but don\u2019t integrate empirical evidence or suggest tests that would distinguish motives (e.g., survey questions about whether people would move to feel superior, discrete-choice experiments that vary neighborhood income while holding amenities constant, instrumental-variable analyses of movers whose moves were low-cost vs high-cost). Actionable fix: add (or at least propose) specific empirical checks or cite literature on positional goods, social comparisons, and migration motives; if you can\u2019t present new evidence, tone down the strong generalization and invite targeted empirical tests.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback pinpoints major inferential and conceptual mistakes: treating non-movement as direct evidence people \u2018barely care\u2019 about relative income, assuming local neighbors are the primary reference group, and relying on anecdotes instead of testable empirical evidence. These are high-impact critiques that, if addressed, would substantially strengthen or properly qualify the post\u2019s central claim without requiring excessive rewriting (e.g., by reframing the claim, acknowledging alternative reference groups/motivations, and proposing or citing simple empirical tests)."

    "explanation": "The post is easy to read, well-structured, and makes a simple, memorable argument with concrete examples (move to poorer areas to get relative wealth). It is rhetorically effective and concise, but rests on unexamined assumptions (migration frictions, social ties, positional goods, stigma) and doesn't address obvious counterarguments or empirical nuance, which weakens the argumentative completeness even though the core point is clear."

    "explanation": "The post's clever rhetorical move\u2014arguing that if people cared mainly about relative income they could simply move to poorer areas, yet they rarely do\u2014is a neat reframing but not a very original substantive claim. EA readers are already familiar with the Easterlin paradox, debates over absolute vs. relative income, positional goods, and migration incentives, so the idea will feel unsurprising (hence a low score). For the general public the move-to-poorer counterexample may register as somewhat novel or striking, but the underlying points (people move for jobs, amenities, family; many prefer richer neighborhoods; relative-status explanations are overused) are common enough that this is only moderately novel."

    "explanation": "The post makes a clever, simple revealed-preference argument: if people mainly cared about being richer than their neighbors, they could cheaply buy that feeling by moving to poorer areas, yet they typically don't. That is a useful intuition and highlights a blind spot in some versions of the 'relative-income' claim. However the reasoning rests on several questionable assumptions: it treats 'relative income' as a one-dimensional payoff easily obtained by changing geographic neighbors; it ignores the costs and non-monetary consequences of moving (amenities, safety, schools, social networks, stigma, local identity); it assumes comparisons are primarily geographic rather than occupational, online, or within social circles; and it neglects frictions in housing and migration markets and the fact that status often comes from being among higher-status peers rather than being surrounded by poorer people. Empirically the post provides almost no systematic evidence\u2014only anecdote and theoretical thought-experiments\u2014and does not cite data on movers' motives, reference groups, or the welfare tradeoffs people face when relocating. For these reasons the argument is suggestive but underdeveloped and poorly supported by evidence."

    "validation_notes": "The post correctly notes that only a small share of moves are explicitly motivated by \u2018better neighborhood\u2019 and that many moves are for housing, family, or jobs (Census). It is also correct that most low\u2011income families face barriers to moving to higher\u2011opportunity / richer neighborhoods and that, when given support, many do move (Chetty et al. / CMTO, MTO). However, the post\u2019s key inference \u2014 that therefore people \u201cbarely care about relative income\u201d \u2014 is not supported. A large empirical literature finds people are sensitive to relative income and inequality (Luttmer 2005; experimental inequality\u2011aversion literature; more recent work on distributional preferences). Moreover, migration choices are constrained and driven by many non\u2011status factors (affordability, information, networks) so the absence of widespread movement into poorer areas is weak evidence against status/relative\u2011income concerns. In short: some descriptive facts the author cites are correct, but they do not justify the sweeping conclusion; the argument ignores substantial evidence that relative comparisons matter and that practical barriers shape observed migration patterns.",
