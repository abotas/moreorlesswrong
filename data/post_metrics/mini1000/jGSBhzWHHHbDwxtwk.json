    "explanation": "This post is a useful and timely prompt for the EA community: up-to-date, published net assessments of existential/catastrophic risks are important inputs for priority-setting, funding, and strategy, and a lack of publicly available assessments (or clear reasoning for that lack) is worth investigating. However, the post is primarily a solicitation / meta-question rather than new evidence or argumentation, so its direct load-bearing value is moderate rather than foundational. For general humanity the issue matters (x-risk estimates shape major policy), but this specific forum query is of limited direct impact unless it catalyses widespread new assessments or policy changes."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Define key terms and narrow the scope. Right now the post asks for \"net assessments\" of \"x-risks\" without saying what counts as either term (military-style net assessment? comparative risk-benefit analyses? peer\u2011reviewed papers, policy reports, or think\u2011tank briefings?), or what timeframe \"recent\" means. Actionable fix: state whether you mean (a) peer\u2011reviewed literature, (b) public policy/think\u2011tank reports, or (c) declassified government assessments, and give a concrete cutoff (e.g. last 5 years). Also clarify which x-risk domains you care about (bio, nuclear, climate, misaligned AI, systemic geopolitical collapse) \u2014 different communities and publication norms apply to each. This will make responses more useful and keep answers short and on\u2011target.\n\n2) Engage existing work and plausible reasons for scarcity. The post assumes there are \"so few\" published assessments but doesn\u2019t acknowledge why that might be true (academic incentives, classified material, commercial/strategic sensitivity, or simply that assessments exist in adjacent forms). Actionable fix: add a short sentence summarizing what you already know (examples you\u2019ve checked) and ask targeted follow\u2011ups: e.g. \u201cAre there recent public net assessments of catastrophic biological risk (2018\u20132025)?\u201d This both avoids reinventing the wheel and invites corrections/citations. If you want, mention a few places readers should check (e.g. Future of Humanity Institute, Global Priorities Institute, RAND/CSIS/NTI reports, National Academies, IPCC for climate) so respondents can point to gaps rather than retread known sources.\n\n3) Reframe speculative/political scenarios and add safety/ethics guardrails. The paragraph about \"Trump2\" and acts of war/genocide reads as wide, speculative, and could be misinterpreted as fishing for tactics that may be harmful or classified. Actionable fix: either frame such scenarios explicitly as high\u2011level, normative prompts for scenario analysis (e.g. \u201cHow would illiberal shifts change incentive structures for state and non\u2011state actors?\u201d) or remove the provocative examples. Add a brief safety/ethics note asking respondents not to share operational/illicit advice and to keep discussion at the level of policy, incentives, and ethical considerations. That keeps the post publishable on EA Forum and focuses replies on constructive, public\u2011facing work.\n\nImplementing these three changes will make the post much easier to answer, reduce noise from speculation, and increase the chance of getting concrete citations and usable suggestions for new opportunities.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback identifies the post\u2019s main weaknesses: key-term vagueness (what counts as a \u2018net assessment\u2019, which x\u2011risks, and what timeframe), an unexamined assumption that assessments are scarce, and a potentially risky/polemical framing (the Trump2/war/genocide examples). All three points are actionable and would materially improve answer quality and safety without greatly lengthening the post. It could be slightly stronger by offering a couple more concrete example sources or by noting that different audiences (academics vs. policymakers) expect different evidence, but overall it targets major problems and prevents predictable low\u2011value or hazardous replies."

    "post_id": "jGSBhzWHHHbDwxtwk",
    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The post is generally clear and focused: it asks why there are few recent published \"net assessments\" of existential/catastrophic risks (excluding AI), gives geopolitical context, and invites discussion about new opportunities or threats under illiberal shifts. Strengths are its direct questions and topical framing (e.g. Trump2, EAG London). Weaknesses are minor ambiguity about key terms (what exactly the author means by \"net assessments\" and what counts as \"published\"), a few slightly awkward or provocative phrasings that could distract, and multiple related sub-questions that could be tightened or separated for greater precision."

    "novelty_humanity": 5,
    "explanation": "For an EA/longtermist audience the post raises familiar points: that most x\u2011risk work is sensitive or government\u2011held, that geopolitical shifts change incentives, and that this creates both new threats and opportunities. Those connections and the call for recent published \u2018\u2018net assessments\u2019\u2019 are not new to readers who track policy and security. To a general educated reader the combination is somewhat less obvious \u2014 the specific focus on a dearth of recent, public, cross\u2011domain net assessments and the prompt to look for new moral\u2011actor opportunities under illiberal political shifts is moderately novel, though still grounded in broadly discussed themes (government secrecy, geopolitical risk, and policy tradeoffs)."

    "explanation": "The post raises interesting and plausible questions (e.g., that much risk assessment happens inside governments and that geopolitical shifts could change what actions are on the table), but it is primarily speculative and underspecified. It lacks definitions (what counts as a \"net assessment\"), structured argumentation, and any citations or empirical examples to support its claims. To be more convincing it would need recent literature references, case studies or declassified assessments, and clearer argument chains about how specific political changes translate into altered risk profiles or opportunities for moral actors."

    "validation_notes": "Mixed / uncertain. The post\u2019s central empirical claim \u2014 that there are \u201cso few recent published net assessments\u201d of existential/global\u2011catastrophic risks \u2014 is not well supported: multiple substantial, recent public assessments and a rapidly growing academic literature exist (e.g., RAND\u2019s 2024 Global Catastrophic Risk Assessment; a 2025 bibliometric review documenting expansion of the GCR/ER literature; several arXiv/academic papers and books from 2020\u20132025). At the same time the author\u2019s secondary claim \u2014 that much risk assessment/mitigation happens inside governments and is not publicly shared \u2014 is supported by longstanding practices (classified National Intelligence Estimates, national pandemic exercises such as Crimson Contagion, selective declassification practices). The geopolitical/\u201cilliberal shifts\u201d premise is also empirically plausible and supported by multiple democracy/authoritarianism trackers showing global democratic backsliding. In short: the complaint that there are \u201cso few\u201d public net assessments is overstated given recent public reports and peer\u2011reviewed/working\u2011paper literature, but concerns about classified government work and changing geopolitical incentives are supported by the evidence.",
