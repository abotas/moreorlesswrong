    "explanation": "Useful, practical critique for EAs who might be tempted to treat procreation as an impact intervention: it highlights cheaper, higher-impact alternatives (donations, gamete donation, mentorship) and argues against moralizing deeply personal decisions. Not foundational for EA or longtermist argumentation because it is short, not rigorous, and omits important counterarguments (e.g., certain longtermist or population\u2011ethics calculations, downstream effects of raising value-aligned people). For general humanity the post is of minor importance \u2014 it may influence some individuals' thinking but is unlikely to change large-scale behavior or policy."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Don't make the bednets-children equivalence without transparent math and sources. The claim that \u201cdonating $10k to bednets is roughly equivalent to two extra children existing\u201d is confusing and likely incorrect as stated \u2014 bednets avert child deaths, they don't directly substitute for births, and GiveWell-style cost-effectiveness estimates are needed. Either remove the numeric equivalence or add a short worked example and citations (e.g. GiveWell/AMF estimates for cost per child life saved, assumptions about lifetime fertility/population effects) so readers can judge the claim.  \n\n2) Address longterm and social effects of having children (and why sperm/egg donation or mentorship are not always good substitutes). You treat reproduction as replaceable by donations or mentoring, but that overlooks plausible long-run consequences: descendants can have large, compounding downstream impact; parents shape values, institutions and norms in ways mentorship/short-term interventions often cannot; and selective gametes are a very limited lever (and ethically fraught). Add an explicit paragraph acknowledging these counterarguments, say why you think they\u2019re weaker (or concede uncertainty), and cite any relevant literature or thought experiments.  \n\n3) Tone down broad, categorical claims about ethics and personal drives and fix weak evidence appeals. Lines like \u201cit\u2019s a bad idea to make ethical arguments either way\u201d and relying on a regret subreddit as evidence are overbroad. Reframe the post as pragmatic personal advice (\"consider impact, but don\u2019t make it the main driver if you have a strong desire to parent\") and either remove or back up empirical claims about parental happiness/regret with peer-reviewed studies or reputable surveys. This will avoid alienating readers who expect rigorous EA-style reasoning and make the piece more credible and useful.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback points out major, high-impact weaknesses: an unsupported numerical equivalence (which reads like a careless claim and will undermine credibility), omission of longterm/descendant effects that are central to EA debates, and reliance on weak evidence/tone that will alienate the target audience. Fixing these would materially strengthen the post without huge lengthening and prevent obvious 'own-goal' criticisms."

    "explanation": "Generally clear and well\u2011structured: numbered points, direct prose, and concrete alternatives (donate bednets, donate gametes, mentorship) make the main message easy to follow. Strengths: readable tone, logical sequencing, practical suggestions, and a clear concluding recommendation to follow personal desires rather than moral pressure. Weaknesses: a few unsupported or vague claims (e.g. the $10k = two children equivalence, \"idiocracies\"), occasional blunt/informal phrasing, and some mixing of empirical and moral claims without evidence. These limit argumentative precision but do not seriously obstruct comprehension."

    "explanation": "Most of the core claims are already familiar within EA/longtermist and population\u2011ethics discussions \u2014 e.g. procreation vs donations, cost\u2011effectiveness comparisons, mentorship as leverage, and critiques of moralizing reproduction. The specific framing choices (a concrete $10k/\u2018two children\u2019 equivalence, recommending sperm/egg donation as the practical genetic alternative, and the strong meta\u2011claim to avoid ethicalizing procreation) are slightly distinctive but not groundbreaking for an EA audience. For the general public, several points (especially the donation equivalence and the practical suggestion to donate gametes rather than have children for impact) will feel more novel, though the overall thrust overlaps with existing antinatalist and family\u2011planning arguments."

    "explanation": "The post raises several plausible and important points (opportunity costs of parenting, alternatives like donations/mentorship, the distinction between ethical vs. personal reasons), and some arguments are rhetorically clear. However the reasoning is often underspecified, sometimes confused (e.g. the bednet/$10k \u2248 two-children claim is vague and unmotivated), and it fails to engage with key counterarguments (long\u2011term/lineage effects, demographic dynamics, cultural transmission, expected future altruism of descendants). Empirical support is minimal and consists largely of anecdata and a couple of informal links rather than systematic evidence or citations, so the quantitative claim that having kids is dominated by these alternatives is not convincingly established. Overall the thesis is plausible as a normative recommendation (don\u2019t have children solely for impact), but it is not well substantiated as a general empirical claim that having children is the least effective way to improve the world."

    "validation_notes": "Most empirical claims in the post are supported by reliable evidence but some are simplified or over-generalised. GiveWell/AMF estimates (\u2248$3k\u2013$8k per death averted) make the author\u2019s back-of-envelope claim that ~$10k of ITN/bednet funding is roughly \u2018equivalent\u2019 to order\u20111\u20133 extra lives (so \u201c~two\u201d is a reasonable rough claim), though exact numbers depend on location and assumptions. The statement that raising a child in the U.S. costs hundreds of thousands is supported by USDA estimates. Evidence shows a non-trivial minority of parents report regretting parenthood (estimates vary by country/study, ~5\u201317%), so the claim that regret is more common than publicly discussed is plausible. Mentor/advocacy programs (e.g., Big Brothers Big Sisters RCTs) show measurable but modest positive effects and are scalable \u2014 however, the claim that mentorship is categorically \u201cway more effective per effort\u201d than parenting is an overreach: parenting has large, long-run causal impacts on child outcomes and is not directly comparable to one-off mentoring interventions. Finally, the literature on parents\u2019 subjective well\u2011being is mixed and context-dependent, consistent with the post\u2019s caution that happiness effects are unclear. Overall: well-supported for the main empirical anchors (bednets cost-effectiveness, cost-to-raise-a-child, prevalence of parental regret, mixed wellbeing literature), but several normative or comparative effectiveness claims are stated too strongly given heterogeneity and uncertainty.",
