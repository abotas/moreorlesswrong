    "explanation": "This is a routine request for feedback on Rethink Priorities' animal-welfare work. It could modestly affect RP's priorities, methods, and usefulness to the animal-advocacy community if many relevant people respond, but it makes no substantive claims and is not foundational to EA or longtermist reasoning. It is essentially administrative/organisational rather than world-important, and has negligible direct impact on general humanity."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Add clear privacy/consent details \u2014 currently there\u2019s no information about anonymity, how responses will be used, whether quotes may be published or attributed, who will have access, data retention, or whether follow\u2011ups are allowed. Without this people may withhold candid criticism. Action: add a brief sentence (or a one\u2011line bullet) explaining whether responses are anonymous/confidential, where data is stored, whether you\u2019ll publish aggregated results or quotes, and how respondents can opt out of follow\u2011up.  \n\n2) Define and screen the eligible population more precisely \u2014 the footnote definition (\u201cread any write\u2011ups\u2026\u201d) is very broad and will likely pull in people with only cursory exposure, which can dilute or bias results. Action: either tighten the definition (e.g., read X report, attended Y event, used RP research in decision\u2011making) or add 1\u20132 short screening questions at the start (e.g., level of familiarity, which products/events they engaged with, recency) and plan to stratify/weight responses by familiarity.  \n\n3) Reduce participation friction and increase trust/transparency \u2014 the post omits practical details that affect response rates and trust (no info on incentives, no timezone for the deadline, shortened link destination, and no promise to share outcomes). Action: say whether you\u2019re offering payment or not, give the deadline timezone, replace the short URL with the full destination or preview it, and commit to sharing a short public summary of findings and planned changes. These small additions will increase response rates and the usefulness of replies.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback identifies several substantive, actionable flaws that could materially harm response rate, data quality, and ethics: missing privacy/consent details (which can suppress candid criticism), an overly broad eligibility definition (which risks diluting or biasing results), and practical trust/friction issues (incentives, timezone, link transparency, and sharing results). These fixes are compact and feasible to add and would meaningfully improve the post\u2019s effectiveness and credibility."

    "explanation": "Clear, well-structured call-to-action: target audience, purpose, link, deadline, and time estimate are all stated and a footnote defines \"engaged with.\" Minor issues: slightly awkward phrasing in places, noisy formatting (bold, emoji, image), and the deadline lacks a year which could cause ambiguity for some readers."

    "explanation": "This is a routine request for feedback/audience survey from a nonprofit (Rethink Priorities). Asking former readers/attendees to fill an impact survey is a very common practice both within EA circles and more broadly. There are no new arguments, frameworks, or claims \u2014 only an outreach/feedback solicitation with minor specifics (targeted audience, deadline, topic area)."

    "explanation": "The post is a clear, coherent call-to-action and reasonably defines who should respond (strength), but it makes implicit claims about the value of feedback without laying out any reasoning or methodological safeguards (weakness). No empirical evidence, sampling plan, survey design, or incentives are provided, so there is little basis to judge how useful or representative the eventual results will be."

The only minor points are subjective (the survey '10\u201325 minutes' estimate) and the shortened link target was not resolved here, so the exact form contents/time-to-complete were not independently confirmed.",
