    "explanation": "This is high-value, practical meta-advice for people doing ML/AI research (especially mechanistic interpretability and safety-adjacent work). It isn\u2019t foundational theory, but it is load-bearing for research quality: clear narratives, rigorous experiments, red\u2011teaming, strong baselines, reproducibility, and honest limitations materially improve whether work is trusted, built on, and used in downstream safety decisions. For the EA/rationalist community (many of whom do or fund ML/AI research), adopting this guidance would significantly raise the signal-to-noise of the literature and reduce wasted effort. For general humanity the impact is much smaller: better papers indirectly benefit society through improved science and less hype, but this advice mainly affects researchers and has only modest direct societal consequences."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Overgeneralisation from mech\u2011interp to all ML. You repeatedly present advice as if it applies across ML, but your caveat about specializing in mechanistic interpretability is brief and then ignored. This will mislead readers in systems, theory, optimisation, or applied ML where norms (e.g. what counts as evidence, baselines, acceptable appendices) differ. Actionable fix: add a short section or callouts mapping which recommendations are field\u2011dependent (e.g. experiments vs proofs vs benchmarks), with 2\u20133 concrete examples of how to adapt the advice for: (a) theoretical papers, (b) large\u2011scale systems/benchmark papers, and (c) applied/product work. This keeps the post short but prevents readers in other subfields from overapplying the guidance.\n\n2) Statistical/experimental guidance is too blunt and risks giving false confidence. Advising readers to treat p<.001 as a rule of thumb and lumping replication literature advice into a single paragraph is misleading: it ignores power analyses, multiple comparisons, effect sizes/CI reporting, pre\u2011registration, model/seed variability, and Bayesian alternatives. Actionable fix: replace the single threshold recommendation with a compact \"Experimental rigour checklist\" (2\u20136 bullets) that includes: (a) report effect sizes and confidence intervals, (b) state and correct for multiple comparisons or control the false discovery rate, (c) do power / sample\u2011size calculations where feasible, (d) pre\u2011register key confirmatory experiments or clearly separate exploratory analyses, (e) report random seeds/hyperparameter sweeps and uncertainty across runs. A short pointer to resources (e.g. tutorial on CI vs p\u2011values, pre\u2011registration platforms) is enough \u2014 no long digression.\n\n3) LLMs for literature review: add critical guardrails. Recommending LLMs for lit reviews without warning about hallucinated papers and citation errors is an own goal: readers might cite non\u2011existent work or miss key prior art. Actionable fix: keep the LLM suggestion but add a two\u2011sentence warning plus a tiny verification workflow: (a) use LLMs to generate keywords, candidate paper lists, and search queries; (b) verify every suggested citation by checking Google Scholar/DB, reading abstracts and the original paper before citing; (c) use backward/forward citation chaining and curated sources (Semantic Scholar, arXiv, conference proceedings) for confirmation. Optionally include one example prompt and an example verification step so readers can copy it.",
    "improvement_potential": "The three points identify real, concrete weaknesses that could lead readers to make embarrassing mistakes if they follow the advice uncritically. (1) The post does risk overgeneralisation beyond mechanistic interpretability despite the brief caveat \u2014 a short mapping to other subfields would prevent misuse without much added length. (2) The p<.001 recommendation and the brief treatment of statistical practice is too blunt and omits crucial items (power, effect sizes, multiple comparisons, seeds, pre-registration); replacing a single-threshold heuristic with a compact experimental-rigour checklist would materially improve the post\u2019s correctness and utility. (3) Recommending LLMs for literature review without mentioning hallucinations or a verification loop is an own goal; adding two sentences and a tiny verification workflow (plus an example prompt) would prevent obvious citation errors. Each suggested fix is practical, concise, and would substantially reduce the risk of misleading readers."

    "explanation": "Neel Nanda is a well-known researcher and popular explainer in the mechanistic interpretability / AI-safety community who posts tutorials, papers, and talks that are widely read within EA/rationalist and alignment circles. He is not a central EA leader, but he is a recognizable and influential figure among those who follow AI interpretability. Outside AI/EA/professional research communities his public recognition is limited to being known within specific professional/online circles rather than broadly famous."

    "post_id": "E5qW6SKgpFpSfD5Pp",
    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "Well-structured and highly readable for the intended audience (ML researchers): strong TL;DR, clear headings, concrete checklists, examples and visuals make the central argument (narrative + rigorous evidence) compelling. Strengths: logical flow, actionable steps, good use of bullets and examples, emphasis on figures/experiments/replication. Weaknesses: long and occasionally repetitive; assumes domain knowledge (some jargon and field-specific digressions); a few tangents (novelty/social norms, tacit knowledge) could be tighter. Overall clear and useful, but could be slightly more concise for broader audiences."

    "novelty_humanity": 5,
    "explanation": "This post is largely a well\u2011crafted synthesis of existing, fairly widely known advice for writing ML/CS papers (narrative-driven claims, rigorous experiments, baselines, ablations, figures, iterative drafting). For EA Forum readers \u2014 many of whom are ML-aware and familiar with similar guides (Steinhardt, Foerster, Olah-style posts, and community mentoring) \u2014 most points will feel familiar, so novelty is low. The mildly novel bits are practical emphases and stylistic prescriptions (e.g. equal time on abstract/intro/figures, using LLMs for quick lit reviews, treating high\u2011quality replications/negative results as legitimately \u201cnovel\u201d, strict p\u2011value caution like p<.001, recommending appendices for tacit knowledge). For the general educated public these ideas are less common, so the piece is moderately novel as an accessible, concrete how\u2011to for ML paper writing."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post is logically organised, coherent and internally consistent \u2014 it lays out a clear thesis (compress to 1\u20133 claims + rigorous evidence), justifies why that approach helps communication and scientific reliability, and gives concrete, actionable steps (structure, figures, iterative process, red\u2011teaming, baselines, reproducibility). The author repeatedly acknowledges caveats and tradeoffs, ties recommendations to common failure modes, and illustratively applies the advice to their own papers. Weaknesses: The empirical support is mostly experiential/anecdotal and example\u2011based rather than systematic; there are a few useful citations (e.g. NeurIPS consistency experiment, replication statistics) but many prescriptive claims (e.g., time allocation across abstract/intro/figures, specific thresholds for p\u2011values) lack broad empirical validation and may not generalise across subfields. Overall: Very good practical reasoning and persuasive for readers seeking writing best practices, but moderate empirical evidence \u2014 recommend treating it as well\u2011informed guidance rather than proven, universally optimal procedure."

    "validation_notes": "Most of the post\u2019s concrete empirical claims are accurate and verifiable. Key factual points \u2014 the NeurIPS 2021 consistency experiment showing large reviewer disagreement, the pooled forecasting/replicability analysis (Gordon et al. 2021) with the reported ~74% vs ~28% replication split by p-value category, the grokking paper (arXiv:2301.05217) and the \u2018\u2018Refusal\u2026single direction\u2019\u2019 paper (arXiv:2406.11717) \u2014 are all real and match the cited figures. The post\u2019s broader claims about replication problems in science are well-supported by metascience work (e.g., Ioannidis 2005) and the suggested change to stricter p-value thresholds is precisely the Benjamin et al. (2018) proposal. The author\u2019s self-reported mentoring/supervision numbers are corroborated by his public bio / LinkedIn statements. Caveats: much of the post is prescriptive opinion (writing advice) rather than empirical claim, so those parts aren\u2019t \u201cverifiable\u201d in the same sense. Also the sweeping phrasing that \u201cmany published papers are basically false or wildly misleading\u201d is a qualitative summary of a complex literature \u2014 supported in spirit by metascience evidence but over-generalised if interpreted as a universal numeric claim. Overall: the major empirical claims checked are accurate and well-sourced, but several statements are normative/advice (not empirical) and some simplifications are made when summarising complex metascience findings.",
