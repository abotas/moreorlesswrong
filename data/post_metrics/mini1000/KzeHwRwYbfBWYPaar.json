    "explanation": "This is a practical, actionable post about increasing the policy relevance of social\u2011science research. For the EA/rationalist community it is moderately important: useful for researchers and advocacy groups trying to increase real\u2011world impact, shaping how research questions are chosen and how evidence is translated into policy, but it is not foundational to core EA claims (e.g., about x\u2011risk or cause prioritization). For general humanity it has minor-to-moderate importance: if the recommended practices (co\u2011creation, early engagement, workshops, consensus building) are adopted widely, research uptake and policy quality could improve, but the post itself is a pragmatic guide rather than a high\u2011stakes theoretical breakthrough."

    "robustness_score": 3,
    "actionable_feedback": "1) Missing discussion of trade-offs and risks from co\u2011creation. The summary presents early engagement with policymakers as an unambiguously good thing, but does not acknowledge common downsides (policy capture, compromised scientific independence, incentives for produceable-but-less-rigorous work, resource and time costs). Actionable fix: add a short paragraph listing these trade\u2011offs and, where possible, concrete mitigation strategies (e.g. governance safeguards, pre\u2011registered analytic plans, independent peer review).\n\n2) Too vague / light on concrete evidence of impact. The post claims approaches \u201cmake research more relevant and usable\u201d but gives no metrics, outcomes, or brief case examples demonstrating uptake or changed policy. Actionable fix: include 1\u20132 succinct examples from the linked report with measurable outcomes (what changed, who used it, timeline), or explicitly state where evidence of impact is weak. That will make the claim credible without lengthening the piece much.\n\n3) Limited attention to context and generalisability. Relying on UK/EU/international examples risks implying these methods scale everywhere; they may not apply in low\u2011resource, highly politicized, or small\u2011agency settings. Actionable fix: add a one\u2011sentence caveat about contextual limits and suggest where the approaches are most vs least likely to work, or call out that follow\u2011up work will address timing/tool design and contextual constraints.",
    "improvement_potential": "The three points identify real, nontrivial omissions that undermine the post's credibility: failure to note trade\u2011offs of co\u2011creation, lack of concrete impact evidence, and overstating generalisability. Each suggestion is actionable and can be implemented with a sentence or two (or one brief example) so they materially improve the post without bloating it. These are important but not catastrophic omissions, so the feedback is highly useful though not a 10."

No prominent publications, talks, or citations are attributable to that name, so they appear to have minimal or no public presence."

    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The post is clear, concise, and easy to follow: it states the main question, summarizes the author's approach (early engagement, co-creation, workshops), and notes relevant examples and intended audience. It could be improved with one or two concrete examples or specifics about the methods and a clearer signal about who will respond to comments (the attribution/auto-summary note is slightly distracting), but overall it communicates its purpose and utility well."

    "explanation": "The post surveys well-established practices from the research\u2011impact and knowledge\u2011translation literature (early engagement with policymakers, co\u2011creation, workshops, consensus\u2011building to build trust and uptake). Among EA Forum readers\u2014who are already familiar with evidence\u2011based policy and research translation\u2014these ideas are quite familiar. For a general educated audience the content is somewhat less familiar but still mainstream in policy and academic circles; the only mildly novel elements are specific practical examples (UK/EU cases) and emphasis on timing and tool design shaping use, which are incremental rather than original."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post presents a clear, plausible logic \u2014 identifying a researcher\u2013policy gap and proposing concrete, well-motivated methods (co\u2011creation, workshops, consensus processes) for closing it. It sensibly links early engagement to trust and uptake and notes timing/tool design as important. Weaknesses: The argumentation appears largely practical and illustrative rather than analytical \u2014 it does not deeply interrogate trade\u2011offs (e.g. bias, capture, resource constraints), causal mechanisms, or boundary conditions. Evidence is mainly case examples from UK/EU/international work, which are useful but anecdotal and likely subject to selection and generalizability limits; there is little sign of rigorous evaluation or systematic comparison of methods. Overall: a useful, well-structured starting thesis with moderate empirical backing but insufficient rigorous evidence to be definitive."

    "validation_notes": "The post\u2019s central empirical claims are generally supported by credible evidence: (a) early engagement / co\u2011creation, workshops and consensus processes are widely reported to improve the relevance, usability and uptake of research by policymakers (multiple reviews and case studies); (b) concrete examples cited (UK Top Ten Questions process, the UK What Works approach, and the European Commission\u2019s JRC/KCMD and co\u2011creation initiatives) are real and use the methods described. however, the literature also stresses important caveats: rigorous causal evidence that co\u2011production reliably produces sustained policy change or improved outcomes is limited; most studies show improvements in process outcomes (relevance, relationships, trust) and short\u2011term uptake but call for stronger evaluation of long\u2011term policy impact. Given solid descriptive and review evidence plus well\u2011documented real\u2011world examples but limited high\u2011quality causal evaluation, a \u201cwell\u2011supported\u201d score (7) is appropriate.",
