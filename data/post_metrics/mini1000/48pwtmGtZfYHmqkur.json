I cannot find notable publications, talks, citations, or leadership roles tied to that name; it may be a minor online alias or pseudonym with little public presence."

    "explanation": "This post flags a potentially high-impact but highly uncertain omission in cost\u2011effectiveness accounting used by influential EA animal\u2011welfare evaluators. If the author\u2019s claims hold up, they could materially change prioritisation and expected\u2011value estimates for many interventions (e.g., farmed animal advocacy, dietary campaigns, and even some global\u2011health work) and so are load\u2011bearing for some EA decision processes. However, the argument rests on contested assumptions (probabilities of invertebrate sentience, welfare per animal, and chained ecological effects) and large epistemic uncertainty, so its practical consequences are plausible but far from settled. For general humanity the scope is much narrower: interesting and potentially important for niche policy/prioritisation debates but unlikely to shift mainstream public decisions soon."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Over\u2011precision from extremely fragile arithmetic: the huge multipliers (e.g. 1.82M\u00d7, 87.6k\u00d7) appear to come from multiplying very uncertain small probabilities, huge population counts, and contested welfare-per\u2011animal assumptions. That makes the numerical claims extremely sensitive to tiny changes in assumptions and likely to be interpreted as stronger evidence than they are. Actionable fix: either drop/soften the headline multipliers or present them as a small set of explicit scenarios with clear sensitivity bounds (e.g. show how results change if key inputs vary by an order of magnitude). Add a short paragraph or figure showing which assumptions drive the results (a one\u2011page sensitivity analysis) so readers can see the fragility instead of the precise numbers dominating the impression.  \n\n2) Important normative and empirical assumptions are treated as scalars and under\u2011defended (sentience priors, welfare per animal\u2011year, and the \u201cnegative lives\u201d assumption). You compare QALYs across very different taxa without sufficiently engaging with the normative choices (how to weight different kinds of consciousness, duration/intensity, moral uncertainty). Actionable fix: explicitly state the moral weighting rule(s) you used, show results under alternative plausible moral/metric frameworks (e.g. equal welfare\u2011weighting, credence\u2011weighted sentience, and a conservative non\u2011sentience cutoff), and justify (or label as speculative) the negative\u2011lives assumption. If you want to keep the post short, replace single point estimates with a small table of 3\u20135 robustness checks.  \n\n3) Weak treatment of causal pathways / land\u2011use feedbacks and counterarguments that would overturn your main channels. Many interventions don\u2019t mechanically translate into proportional changes in cropland or soil\u2011animal populations (e.g. dietary change can reduce feed demand, corporate campaigns may change husbandry without changing land, health interventions don\u2019t inevitably increase cropland). Actionable fix: add a concise causal map for the key intervention types (corporate campaigns, Veganuary, GiveWell interventions, dietary choices) listing the main causal steps and the most plausible alternative pathways. Then indicate which pathways are necessary for your big claims to hold and which empirical estimates would resolve the largest uncertainties (so readers and organisations know what targeted evidence would matter).",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback hits the post's three biggest vulnerabilities: extreme sensitivity of the headline multipliers, treating contested normative/empirical inputs as single scalars, and weak causal/land\u2011use modeling. Each point identifies an own goal the author would be embarrassed by (overprecision, unexamined sentience/negative\u2011lives assumptions, and oversimplified causal chains) and gives concise, actionable fixes (sensitivity checks, alternative weighting rules, causal maps). Implementing them would substantially improve credibility without necessarily bloating the post. It isn\u2019t exhaustive (e.g. could add advice on uncertainty communication or potential double\u2011counting), so it stops short of a full methodological overhaul, which is why I didn\u2019t score it a 9\u201310."

    "clarity_score": 7,
    "explanation": "Overall the post is well-structured and targeted readers (EA/animal-welfare audiences) can follow the argument: it has a clear summary, headings, explicit claims, and concrete quantitative estimates. Strengths include logical organization, repeated restatement of the central claim, and use of examples to illustrate the probabilistic point. Weaknesses are that it is dense and technical, repeats similar points across sections, uses many acronyms/links that interrupt flow, and the long lists of large ratio estimates lack immediate context for readers unfamiliar with RP\u2019s methods. The writing could be tightened to reduce redundancy and explain key assumptions more simply for broader comprehensibility."

    "explanation": "Within EA/wild-animal-welfare circles the underlying themes (wild-animal suffering, invertebrate sentience, scope effects, and cross-cause impacts) are well-known, but this post advances those debates by explicitly arguing that soil nematodes/mites/springtails will often be the dominant drivers of cost\u2011effectiveness, giving large numerical multipliers, and pressing mainstream evaluators (RP, ACE, AIM, AWF) to include or justify excluding them. For the general public these claims are highly unexpected and original \u2014 most people haven\u2019t considered that microscopic soil fauna could swamp welfare accounting for major interventions or should change charity prioritisation."

    "reasoning_quality": 6,
    "evidence_quality": 3,
    "overall_support": 4,
    "explanation": "Strengths: The post presents a clear, logically consistent argument that very large populations of soil invertebrates mean even modest probabilities of sentience or small per\u2011animal welfare changes can produce large expected impacts; it cites Rethink Priorities' sentience estimates and anticipates common objections about uncertainty and moral\u2011circle thresholds. Weaknesses: The empirical backbone is thin and highly model\u2011dependent \u2014 the dramatic ratios and net harms reported rest on many uncertain assumptions (welfare per animal\u2011year, direction and magnitude of population changes from interventions, the negative\u2011lives claim) that are not robustly empirically supported or sensitivity\u2011tested in the post. It also underaddresses practical considerations (tractability, marginal cost per welfare unit, and intervention causal mechanisms). The thesis is plausible and worth taking seriously, but currently under\u2011evidenced for strong policy prescriptions without further, transparent sensitivity analysis and empirical validation."

    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 6,
    "validation_notes": "Strengths: The post\u2019s core empirical building blocks are supported by high-quality sources \u2014 (a) soil arthropods and nematodes are extremely numerous and vary by biome (Rosenberg et al. 2023; van den Hoogen et al. 2019), and (b) land-use per food\u2011kg differences (Poore & Nemecek 2018) mean changes in cropping can plausibly affect vastly more soil animal life\u2011years than directly affected farmed animals. Rethink Priorities did produce welfare/sentience estimates and discussion of invertebrates (and the RP team explicitly cautions about applying their methods to very simple organisms). ACE and Joey Savoie\u2019s quoted comments are accurately reported in the EA Forum thread. Weaknesses / caveats: the striking numeric ratios in the post (e.g. 28.2\u00d7, 444\u00d7, 3.58k\u00d7, 5.42k\u00d7, 87.6k\u00d7, 1.82M\u00d7) are the author\u2019s model outputs built from many uncertain inputs (density scalings, choice of biome replacements, RP welfare/range choices, sentience probabilities, QALY per animal\u2011year assumptions, behavioural substitution effects, and other modelling choices). Many of those inputs are debatable and the outputs are highly sensitive to them; RP themselves warn about low confidence for applying their methods to nematodes. Conclusion: The post\u2019s central qualitative claim \u2014 that changes in cropland/feeding can have much larger effects on abundant soil fauna than on the small numbers of directly affected farmed animals \u2014 is well supported by the literature. The precise numeric multipliers, however, are model\u2011dependent and should be treated as illustrative/contingent rather than independently established facts.",
