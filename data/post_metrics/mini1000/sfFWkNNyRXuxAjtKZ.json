    "explanation": "I am not aware of any notable EA/rationalist presence for an author named 'Algon' up to my 2024-06 cutoff. No major publications, talks, or widely-cited posts under that name are known to me; it may be a niche or pseudonymous poster. If you can share links or context, I can reassess."
