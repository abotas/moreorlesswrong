    "explanation": "This is an important, high\u2011relevance post for the EA/rationalist community because it targets core epistemic and decision\u2011theoretic norms used in longtermist and AI\u2011safety reasoning. If the post's claims about the rationality and decision\u2011relevance of indeterminate (imprecise) credences are accepted, they materially change how we assess the value of information, prioritize interventions, and respond to 'cluelessness' arguments \u2014 so the conclusions are load\u2011bearing for many EA debates. For general humanity the piece is primarily philosophical and technical: it may influence academic and policy thinking about decision\u2011making under deep uncertainty, but it has limited direct impact on most people or near\u2011term public policy, so its importance is modest."

    "explanation": "Based on my training data through mid\u20112024, I find no evidence that an author named Anthony DiGiovanni is a known figure in the EA/rationalist community or a public intellectual. He appears to be either a private/pseudonymous or minor/obscure author with no significant public presence; if you have a specific work or context, I can reassess."

    "clarity_score": 7,
    "explanation": "Well-structured and aimed at an informed EA/phil audience: the thesis is explicit, the argument is developed step-by-step (key takeaways, motivating example, formal model, decision implications, responses, appendix), and the many references and examples support comprehension. Weaknesses: the piece is dense and long, uses technical jargon and many footnotes that interrupt flow, and contains some formatting/artifact noise (e.g. broken image placeholders and repeated symbols) that slightly impede readability; a more concise summary of practical takeaways for EA practitioners would improve accessibility."

    "explanation": "For an EA/rationalist audience this is mostly an integration and application of already\u2011familiar literature (imprecise probabilities, maximality, debates about cluelessness, Solomonoff/Occam issues, prior aggregation, and recent EA forum posts by Lewis/Mogensen/etc.). The piece is a clear, well\u2011argued synthesis and it emphasizes some practical consequences (e.g. insensitivity to mild sweetening, resolving indeterminacy with non\u2011consequentialist or meta reasons), but it advances few genuinely novel technical claims. For a general educated reader, however, the package is substantially more novel: the formal idea of representing credences as sets of distributions, the maximality decision rule, and the consequences for longtermist/AI policy reasoning are relatively unfamiliar and present a striking alternative to the common \u2018\u2018go with your best guess\u2019\u2019 intuition."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post is conceptually careful and well structured \u2014 it defines terms, connects to formal models (imprecise probabilities, representors), proposes a clear decision rule (maximality), and engages thoughtfully with major objections (aggregation, forecasting performance, permissiveness). The author cites relevant literature and gives plausible illustrative examples. Weaknesses: The argument is largely philosophical and analytic rather than empirical; empirical support is limited to indirect evidence (forecasting calibration, behavioral biases) and there are few concrete, data-driven case studies showing that indeterminate credences improve real-world decisions in the EA contexts claimed. Some claims depend on normative premises (e.g., about what counts as non-arbitrary) and on how vagueness should be modeled, which remain disputed. Overall, the post persuasively establishes that determinate credences are not obviously required, but it stops short of decisive empirical support that adopting indeterminacy yields better decision-making in the relevant domains."

    "validation_notes": "Summary: The post\u2019s central empirical/conceptual claims are well grounded in the academic literature. Key factual claims \u2014 (1) imprecise/indeterminate probabilities can be modelled by sets of probability distributions, (2) the \u2018maximality\u2019 decision rule is the standard unanimity-style extension used with such representors and has the consequence of permitting many actions under deep uncertainty, (3) precise geopolitical forecasters (the Good Judgment Project / \u201csuperforecasters\u201d) have outperformed na\u00efve baselines and professionals on short-to-medium horizons, and (4) Solomonoff/Occam-style priors face language\u2011dependence and uncomputability worries \u2014 are all documented and widely discussed in philosophy and forecasting literatures. Sources I consulted (below) directly support those points (SEP entry on imprecise probabilities; Mogensen on maximality/cluelessness; Tetlock / Good Judgment Project on forecasting performance; papers on Solomonoff/Kolmogorov issues; H\u00e1jek & Smithson and Bradley on indeterminate credences and decision theory).\n\nLimitations / where the post is speculative: The main normative/empirical leap \u2014 that humans should adopt indeterminate credences about the long\u2011term future in ways that materially change EA cause prioritization \u2014 is philosophical and conditional, not an empirical fact; it depends on contested normative premises and difficult extrapolations (how to transfer forecasting calibration from geopolitical domains to unprecedented long\u2011term scenarios). The post itself frames many of those as open questions. On those speculative points there is not (and cannot plausibly be) decisive empirical evidence yet \u2014 the literature documents the possibility and philosophical plausibility of indeterminacy and shows real practical consequences of different decision rules, but it does not empirically establish that longtermist credences should be severely indeterminate in practice. Overall rating: 8/10 \u2014 well-supported for its descriptive and conceptual claims; lower confidence for its stronger empirical/normative claims about effects on long\u2011term EA prioritization because those are necessarily speculative and underdetermined.",

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Underplay of coordination/communication and practical costs \u2014 The post argues for indeterminate beliefs as an epistemic ideal but doesn\u2019t engage enough with real-world costs of refusing to give determinate numbers (coordination, persuasion, funding decisions, reporting to stakeholders, legal/regulatory processes). Actionable fix: add a short section that (a) distinguishes private/internal indeterminacy from public/coordination needs, (b) gives clear heuristics for when to keep indeterminacy (e.g. internal deliberation, research-prioritization) versus when to commit to a precisified public estimate (e.g. to coordinate donors or regulators), and (c) discusses the cost\u2013benefit tradeoffs and simple procedures (e.g. report an imprecise interval plus a single canonical \u2018operational point estimate\u2019 and its rationale). This prevents the piece coming across as impractical or reckless for EA decision-making.  \n\n2) Weak engagement with decision-theoretic arguments for precision \u2014 Several strong decision-theory and epistemic-utility arguments favor sharp credences (scoring rules/calibration, diachronic coherence, Expected Utility representation results). The post mentions these briefly but largely dismisses aggregation and higher-order weighting without confronting the best-formulated objections and empirical benefits of precisification. Actionable fix: directly address (and cite) the strongest counterarguments: (a) epistemic-utility/scoring-rule results that penalize imprecision, (b) diachronic money-pump/coherence concerns and why they do or do not defeat indeterminacy in practice, and (c) the practical success of aggregation/ensemble methods. Either concede more limited domains where indeterminacy is plausible, or show by example/argument where those decision-theoretic costs are outweighed.  \n\n3) Skips operational middle grounds and decision rules \u2014 The post frames a binary choice (precise Bayesianism vs set-valued maximality) but largely overlooks operational alternatives (robust/\u0393\u2011minimax, maxmin expected utility, Hurwicz criteria, IP-specific scoring rules, ensemble/meta-Bayesian approaches) that practitioners might prefer. Actionable fix: add a concise taxonomy of available middle-ground methods, say why you picked maximality as the focal rule, and clarify whether your claims about decision-relevance apply equally to these alternatives. Give at least one concrete worked example (short, toy but realistic) showing how indeterminacy + a plausible tie-breaking rule leads to different decisions than a picked aggregation \u2014 this will make the stakes and tradeoffs concrete for EA readers.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback identifies several substantive gaps that materially affect the post\u2019s persuasiveness for an EA audience: insufficient treatment of coordination/communication costs (practical own-goal for a community that frequently needs to share numbers), underengagement with the strongest decision-theoretic objections (scoring rules, diachronic coherence, ensemble/aggregation benefits), and omission of operational middle-ground decision rules and a concrete worked example. Addressing these would substantially strengthen the post without overturning its core thesis and would remove places where readers are likely to object or feel the author overlooked obvious practical tradeoffs."
