    "explanation": "Practical advice on discourse norms that is moderately useful for the EA/rationalist community where meta-accusations often derail threads \u2014 it can materially improve clarity, persuasion, and conflict resolution in forums and meetings. Not foundational to EA cause areas (AI safety, global health, etc.), so its truth or falsehood has limited systemic impact. For general humanity it's a useful but low-scale tip about conversational etiquette and won't meaningfully change major outcomes."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Overstated, absolutist claim \u2014 add clear exceptions and decision rules.\n- Problem: The post presents a blanket rule (\u201cdon\u2019t accuse\u2026\u201d) without admitting common and important exceptions (e.g., repeated pattern of bad-faith behaviour, public misinformation that harms others, coordinated epistemic malpractice in a group). That makes the advice brittle and likely misleading to readers.\n- Actionable fix: Add a short paragraph that lists when a meta/epistemic accusation is warranted and what minimal evidence/criteria justify it (e.g., repeated refusal to engage with direct evidence, clear pattern of motivated reasoning, demonstrable harms from continued misinformation). Keep it brief: one or two short bullet points with \u201cIf X and Y hold, consider a careful meta-accusation (see phrasing below).\u201d\n\n2) Advice is too blunt and lacks safer, evidence-backed wording options.\n- Problem: Telling people to default to \u201cYou\u2019re wrong\u201d and to sometimes say \u201cYou\u2019re lying\u201d encourages confrontational or accusatory language that can backfire more than the ambiguous phrasing the post criticises. The post also doesn\u2019t give better concrete alternatives to \u201cinsufficiently truth-seeking\u201d beyond blunt tags.\n- Actionable fix: Replace the single-line prescriptions with a tiny toolbox: 2\u20134 calibrated phrasings tied to specific situations (object-level error, likely error from misunderstanding, suspected motivated reasoning, clear lie). For example: \u201cI think this claim is false because [evidence]\u201d; \u201cCan you show the source for X?\u201d; \u201cYou seem to be ignoring evidence Y \u2014 is there a reason?\u201d; reserve \u201clying\u201d only when you have direct evidence. This both reduces reader uncertainty and keeps the post short.\n\n3) Missing guidance on how to justify meta-claims and on escalation pathways.\n- Problem: The post correctly flags ambiguity in \u201cinsufficiently truth-seeking\u201d but doesn\u2019t tell readers how to make that claim responsibly (what evidence to point to) or what to do if they judge someone epistemically problematic (private correction, moderators, public call-outs, tutorials). Without this, readers may either never act when warranted or act clumsily.\n- Actionable fix: Add a two-sentence guideline: (a) only make meta-accusations when you can point to concrete behaviours (ignoring counter-evidence, selective citation, repeated refusal to engage), and (b) prefer private correction or community moderation for repeated problems; offer one short example of a public phrasing for a justified meta-accusation (e.g., \u201cI\u2019m worried there\u2019s a pattern here \u2014 you repeatedly dismiss clear evidence X without addressing it; can you explain?\u201d).\n\nTone note (optional): The post\u2019s blunt language and profanity will reduce its persuasive reach. Dial down the profanity and swap a sentence or two for neutral phrasing \u2014 that will make the advice land better with readers who already get defensive about meta-accusations.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback identifies several substantial omissions and own-goals in the post (overly absolutist rule, advice that can increase hostility, lack of criteria for warranted meta-accusations, and tone issues). It gives concise, actionable fixes that would materially improve the post\u2019s clarity, practicality, and persuasiveness without bloating it. It\u2019s not a fatal critique of the thesis, but addresses major weaknesses that should be fixed."

    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The post is generally clear and easy to follow: it has a straightforward thesis, concrete alternative phrasings to use, and numbered reasons why the original phrasing is unhelpful. The voice is direct and the structure (what to say, why not to say it, conclusion) helps comprehension. Weaknesses: the tone is brusque and includes profanity which may distract some readers; it could use a brief example or two and a bit more nuance about borderline cases (when calling out truth-seeking might be appropriate). A few sentences are slightly informal/elliptical, but overall the argument is lucid and compact."

    "explanation": "The core point\u2014don\u2019t make vague meta-accusations about someone\u2019s motives or epistemic stance; be specific about claims or behavior\u2014is standard advice in rationality, debate, and EA communities. EA readers have almost certainly seen this framing before. It may be marginally more novel to general educated readers who aren\u2019t immersed in EA/rationality norms, but the basic recommendation and suggested phrasings are still common interpersonal-communication guidance rather than a new insight."

    "reasoning_quality": 5,

    "overall_support": 4,
    "explanation": "The post makes a clear, pragmatic argument: accusing someone of being insufficiently truth-seeking is vague and tends to derail to meta-arguments, so being specific (e.g. 'you're wrong', 'you're misleading', 'you're lying') is better. These points are logically plausible and capture common conversational dynamics, but the reasoning is informal, lacks nuance (tone, power dynamics, cases where epistemic critique is justified), and doesn't consider counterarguments. There is almost no empirical or cited evidence, no illustrative examples or research on persuasion/conflict resolution, so the claim is only weakly supported beyond intuition and anecdote."

    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 7,
    "validation_notes": "Overall the post\u2019s empirical claims are well supported: social-psychological research shows that vague accusations about someone\u2019s epistemic motives tend to provoke meta-discussion, source-derogation, and psychological reactance rather than productive object-level engagement; conversational-derailment studies show forceful/attacking language predicts later personal attacks; and persuasion/feedback literature favors specific, behavior-level criticism (or factual correction) over vague moralizing. However, effects are context-dependent: some experiments find hostility has little effect on receptivity in specific online rebuttal settings, and accusations can sometimes increase trust in accusers when veracity is clear and accusers are perceived as non\u2011hypocritical. So the post\u2019s practical recommendation (prefer specific factual criticism like \u201cyou\u2019re wrong\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re lying\u201d when appropriate) is broadly supported, but not an absolute rule in all contexts.",
