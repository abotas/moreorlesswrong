    "explanation": "This is a moderately important governance/procedural proposal for the EA community. If taken seriously it could meaningfully affect legitimacy, accountability, member engagement, and possibly the priorities and behaviour of major EA organisations \u2014 so it matters for internal politics and some strategic decisions. However it isn't foundational to EA\u2019s core claims (cause prioritization, longtermist arguments, AI risk), and the downstream effects on the rest of the world are indirect and uncertain, so its importance for humanity at large is low."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Missing the central tradeoffs and likely counterarguments. The post treats \u201cmore democracy\u201d as an unalloyed good but doesn\u2019t engage with obvious downsides that many readers will flag immediately \u2014 capture by interest groups, loss of decision quality if expert-driven roles are elected, slower/fragmented governance, and the risk that elected leadership prioritises popularity over long-term priorities. Actionable fix: add a short section listing the top 4\u20135 plausible harms and one-sentence mitigation ideas (e.g. hybrid models with elected advisory seats, staggered terms, supermajorities for fiduciary decisions). That will make the poll feel informed rather than purely normative. \n\n2) Practical/legal feasibility and the membership definition are under-specified. Changing governance of charities/nonprofits raises concrete legal and fiduciary constraints (bylaws, tax law, board duties) and implementation choices that materially change outcomes. The post should (a) say whether you\u2019re proposing CEA restructure, a separate society, or both and why, (b) acknowledge legal constraints and note that those need checking, and (c) propose concrete, realistic membership-eligibility rules instead of open questions (for example: \"EA Forum users with \u2265X karma and an active account in last 12 months\" vs \"paid members\" vs \"current volunteers/staff at EA-affiliated orgs\"). For each option give a one-line equity/access tradeoff (e.g. fees exclude low-income contributors). If you don\u2019t want to do the legal work yourself, state that explicitly and invite experts. \n\n3) The poll is too vague to produce useful information. Right now it\u2019s asking whether people want \u2018more democracy\u2019 without specifying the degree, mechanism, or what seats would be elected. Actionable fix: convert the poll into a small set of concrete, mutually comparable options (example choices: A) No change, B) Advisory elected seats only, C) Small fraction of board seats elected by members, D) Majority-elected board within a separate Society parallel to CEA, E) Full membership-based governance with paid membership). For membership rules include selectable options (paid vs forum-criteria vs volunteering) and a question about priorities (representativeness vs expertise vs stability). That will produce actionable, interpretable results rather than free-text opinion.",
    "improvement_potential": "Strong, concrete feedback that identifies the post's main weaknesses: it treats democracy as an unalloyed good, skips legal/feasibility and membership-definition issues, and asks a too-vague poll. The suggestions (list key harms + mitigations, specify CEA vs a separate society, propose concrete membership rules, and turn the poll into clearly comparable options) are actionable and would materially improve usefulness without unduly lengthening the post. Not a fatal flaw in the thesis, but these fixes address major omissions that would otherwise make the poll feel uninformed or unhelpful."

    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The post is easy to understand and well structured: it states the concern (lack of democratic structures), sketches concrete alternatives (a membership association, elected positions, examples like Rotary), and poses concrete questions about membership rules. Its weaknesses are that it is more exploratory than argumentative \u2014 it offers few specifics, tradeoffs, or reasons why elections would improve outcomes \u2014 so it reads as a prompt for discussion rather than a fully developed proposal."

    "novelty_humanity": 2,
    "explanation": "Within EA circles the idea of adding more democratic governance, elected roles, or member associations has come up before, so the core proposal is only mildly novel to Forum readers; the slightly fresher bits are the concrete suggestions (e.g. reserving certain board/executive seats, a parallel \u2018Society of Effective Altruists\u2019, using Forum karma/work affiliation as membership criteria). To the general public the idea is very familiar (many charities and clubs already use member elections), so it\u2019s not novel there."

    "reasoning_quality": 4,
    "evidence_quality": 2,
    "overall_support": 3,
    "explanation": "The post is a reasonable exploratory prompt that identifies a legitimate concern (centralisation) and sketches several concrete options, which is useful for starting discussion. However it contains little structured argumentation or analysis of trade\u2011offs (why elections would improve outcomes, which roles should be elected, how to avoid capture, legal/operational constraints), and it offers only loose analogies (Rotary/Lions) rather than mechanisms. Empirical evidence is essentially absent \u2014 no case studies, data, or research on governance outcomes \u2014 so the thesis is weakly supported overall."

    "validation_notes": "Most empirical claims in the post are accurate and verifiable: (1) there is recurring criticism on the EA Forum and elsewhere that EA governance is insufficiently democratic; (2) major EA organisations (e.g., CEA/Effective Ventures) are structured as charities/centralised entities with boards; and (3) many service charities (Rotary, Lions) are membership associations that elect leaders. The weaker/partly inaccurate claim is the implication that these questions have \u201cnever really been asked\u201d: there are multiple prior EA Forum posts and practical examples (e.g., EA Norway) discussing democratic/ membership governance and concrete proposals. Also much of the post is normative/speculative (proposals for how elections/membership would work), so those parts are not empirical claims to validate.",
