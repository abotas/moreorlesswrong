    "explanation": "This is a practical, evidence-backed communication tip (natural frequencies vs. percentages) that matters for outreach, persuasion, and public-facing risk communication\u2014areas EA groups and safety advocates often engage in. It\u2019s useful and can improve understanding of AI/health risks, but it\u2019s not foundational to core EA or scientific claims. For general humanity it\u2019s a minor but helpful recommendation for clearer public communication rather than a high-impact intervention."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Overgeneralisation and missing important caveats \u2014 the post presents \u201c1 in 5\u201d as uniformly better than \u201c20%\u201d without noting clear exceptions. That invites criticism and undermines credibility. Actionable fix: add a short caveats paragraph listing when frequencies help and when they don\u2019t (or can mislead). For example: \u2022 Natural frequencies are usually better for moderate probabilities and when the audience is low-to-moderate numeracy. \u2022 For very small probabilities (e.g. 1 in 1,000,000) frequencies become unwieldy; percentages, scientific notation, or visual scales may be clearer. \u2022 \u201c1 in X\u201d can create denominator neglect or imply a small sample \u2014 recommend using consistent denominators and absolute numbers where possible. \u2022 When you expect people to do arithmetic or compare many risks, percentages (or both formats) are often preferable. Add a one-line decision rule the reader can follow (e.g., \u201cUse natural frequencies for everyday risk messaging; for very small risks, use percentages or both.\u201d).\n\n2) Weak evidence and unsupported anecdote \u2014 the only empirical support is an anecdote from a workshop. That\u2019s an own goal for a PSA aimed at decision-makers. Actionable fix: either (A) replace or supplement the anecdote with brief citations to the established literature (e.g., Gigerenzer & Hoffrage 1995 on natural frequencies improving Bayesian reasoning; subsequent work on numeracy and format effects), or (B) explicitly label your workshop example as anecdotal and state that it motivated your recommendation but is not proof. A single-sentence suggested edit: \u201cEvidence: studies show natural frequencies often improve comprehension (see Gigerenzer & Hoffrage 1995 and follow-ups); I\u2019ve also observed similar effects anecdotally in workshops.\u201d\n\n3) Lack of concrete, publishable guidance \u2014 the post says \u201cuse 1 in 5\u201d but gives no quick, actionable rules for communicators. Actionable fix: add a 3\u20135 item micro-checklist the author can paste at the end of the PSA (keeps post short but useful). Examples to include: \u2022 Prefer natural frequencies for communicating moderate risks to non-experts. \u2022 Give both formats for mixed audiences: \u201c1 in 5 (20%).\u201d \u2022 Keep denominators consistent when comparing risks. \u2022 Use absolute risks, not relative risks. \u2022 For very small probabilities, prefer percentages or visuals. This will turn the PSA from a single claim into a practical tool for readers.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback correctly identifies the post's main weaknesses: overgeneralization without caveats, reliance on anecdote instead of citing literature, and lack of actionable guidance. Fixes are concrete and low-cost (a short caveats paragraph, one-sentence citation or labeling of the anecdote, and a 3\u20135 item checklist) and would substantially increase credibility and usefulness without greatly lengthening the PSA."

    "explanation": "The post states a single, useful point clearly and is well structured (intro, reasons, example, caveat). It's easy to follow and persuasive at a high level.

    "explanation": "The core claim \u2014 that natural frequencies like \u201c1 in 5\u201d are easier for people to interpret than percentages \u2014 is well-established in cognitive science and risk-communication literature (e.g. Gigerenzer, Kahneman/Tversky, public-health messaging). EA readers and rationalists are very likely already familiar with this advice; the only mildly new angle is explicitly urging its use for AI-risk public communication, but that is an incremental application rather than a novel idea. For the general public the claim is also common in journalism and health communication, so it\u2019s not highly original (though some individuals may not have reflected on the research behind it)."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post makes a clear, plausible argument and correctly appeals to well-known cognitive advantages of natural frequencies (they are often easier to visualize and apply than abstract percentages). The author acknowledges there are trade\u2011offs. Weaknesses: The argument is presented mostly as assertion + anecdote and lacks citations or quantitative evidence. It doesn't explore key boundary conditions (very small or very large probabilities, choice of denominator, cultural/numeric-literacy differences), nor compare alternatives (dual formats, visuals). Given existing research that generally supports natural frequencies, the thesis is plausible, but the post provides weak empirical support and insufficient nuance."

    "validation_notes": "Overall the post\u2019s empirical claims are well supported by the literature: converting probabilities into natural frequencies (e.g., \u201c1 in 5\u201d) reliably improves people\u2019s performance on many probabilistic/Bayesian reasoning tasks relative to probability/percentage formats (Gigerenzer & Hoffrage; meta-analytic evidence). ([pure.mpg.de](https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemFullPage.jsp?itemId=item_2543495_4&view=EXPORT&utm_source=openai), [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29048176/?utm_source=openai)) Empirical work also shows natural frequencies generalize to more complex inference tasks. ([frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01473/full?utm_source=openai)) There is strong evidence that many adults have limited numeracy, so percentages can be hard to interpret for a substantial fraction of the public. ([nces.ed.gov](https://nces.ed.gov/whatsnew/press_releases/12_10_2024.asp?utm_source=openai)) However, the literature also contains important caveats the post does not fully state: some randomized studies find percentages can produce better comprehension for more numerate audiences, and formats interact with numeracy and task demands; therefore \u201c1 in 5\u201d is not universally superior. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4592369/?utm_source=openai)) In addition, simple \u201c1 in X\u201d framings can inflate perceived risk (so they change judgment, not just comprehension), and using inconsistent denominators harms comparisons \u2014 best practice is to tailor format to audience and purpose (or present both formats/visuals), especially for conditional probabilities where natural frequencies are particularly helpful.
