    "explanation": "For the EA/rationalist community this is moderately important: it helps map a broad, underexplored cause area (public institutions, science practices, misinformation, societal values) and can influence careers, research priorities, and funding choices. It\u2019s not a foundational argument or decisive claim, however, so its truth wouldn\u2019t radically shift core EA conclusions. For general humanity the post itself has limited direct impact: the topic (broad societal improvements) is important, but this announcement/profile is mainly informational and unlikely to directly change large-scale outcomes without follow-up, high-impact interventions."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Be far more specific and give readers concrete examples and prioritization guidance. Right now the profile lists four broad areas but gives no signal about which sub-areas are most promising or why. Add 2\u20134 exemplars per area (specific interventions, organizations, or research questions), and a short prioritization rubric (impact, tractability, neglectedness, timelines) so readers can decide whether and how to engage.  \n\n2) Explicitly acknowledge and address major counterarguments and risks. The post assumes that broad societal improvements are unambiguously net-positive; it should call out common failure modes (political infeasibility, capture by special interests, authoritarian misuse, cultural backlash, opportunity costs) and briefly say how promising work in the area could mitigate these risks or how to evaluate whether a proposed intervention is likely to backfire.  \n\n3) Strengthen evidence and evaluation language. Add at least a couple of references or short historical analogies to show where \u2018broad societal improvement\u2019 approaches have succeeded or failed, and propose concrete metrics or short-term milestones to judge progress (policy changes enacted, research reproducibility improvements, measured reductions in salient misinformation spread, shifts in public norms). This will make the profile more actionable and credible to EA readers.",
    "improvement_potential": "This feedback identifies important, non-trivial gaps: the post is high-level and would benefit from concrete exemplars/prioritization, explicit acknowledgement of failure modes/risks, and some evidence/metrics to increase credibility for an EA audience. Addressing these points would substantially improve usefulness and trustworthiness without changing the core claim, though it may require modestly more detail or links rather than long expansions."

    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "Overall clear and well-structured: concise announcement, helpful bullet list of the four main sub-areas, and a clear call for input. Weaknesses: somewhat abstract/vague in places (few concrete examples or evidence), and the note about tractability/personal fit could be more specific to help readers assess relevance."

    "novelty_ea": 3,
    "novelty_humanity": 4,
    "explanation": "Most of the ideas in the post (improving public institutions, scientific research, fighting misinformation, and shifting societal values) are familiar to both the EA community and the broader public. What is modestly novel is the explicit framing of these disparate topics as a single 'broad societal improvements' cause area and the EA\u2011style discussion of tractability, neglectedness, and personal fit. Overall, this is more of a clear synthesis/announcement than a highly original conceptual contribution."

    "reasoning_quality": 5,
    "evidence_quality": 2,
    "overall_support": 4,
    "explanation": "The post gives a clear, coherent framing of 'broad societal improvements' and sensibly divides the topic into plausible subareas while explicitly noting uncertainty and heterogeneity of opportunities. However, the arguments are high-level and largely descriptive rather than analytical: causal pathways, criteria for promising opportunities, and trade-offs are not developed. Empirical evidence is minimal \u2014 there are no data, case studies, metrics, or citations in the post itself to substantiate claims about impact, tractability, or neglectedness. As presented, the thesis is plausible but weakly supported; to strengthen it the profile should add concrete examples, empirical evidence on impact and tractability, and clearer criteria for prioritization."

    "validation_notes": "Most of the post's empirical claims are accurate and verifiable. The Probably Good profile exists and accurately summarizes the four areas (public institutions, scientific research, misinformation/disinformation, societal values). Independent evidence supports the core empirical claims: institutional quality strongly affects societal outcomes (Acemoglu/Robinson and related literature), scientific reproducibility and publishing problems are well-documented (Ioannidis, metascience literature), misinformation/disinformation have demonstrable harms (WHO 'infodemic' guidance, vaccine/mortality studies), and social norms/values shape policy and behaviour (social\u2011norms and moral\u2011psychology research). Specific numerical claims cited on the page (\u2248$1 trillion wasted in procurement; the potential ~$1T magnitude from small improvements in research publishing; millions of researchers and millions of papers published yearly) are supported by reputable sources though exact figures vary by dataset (UNESCO reports ~7.8\u20138+ million researchers; Crossref/Web of Science document millions of annual articles). The statement that this cause area is \u201cless tractable and (often) not very neglected\u201d is a normative assessment consistent with EA/80k-style reasoning and community discussion, but it is an evaluative judgement rather than a purely empirical fact and remains debated. Overall: well-supported, with a few quantitative approximations and normative judgements that are reasonable but not definitive.",
