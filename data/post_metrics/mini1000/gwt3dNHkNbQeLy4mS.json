    "explanation": "This is a useful, clarifying taxonomy aimed at newcomers and communicators in the AI safety / EA space. For the EA/rationalist community it has moderate importance: it helps standardize language, reduce confusion, and shape discussion and policy framing (so it's somewhat load-bearing for discourse and outreach), but it doesn't introduce novel technical claims or high-stakes arguments. For general humanity it's of minor importance: it can improve public understanding and media coverage, but it is not itself critical to decisions about safety, policy, or technology deployment."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Definitions are presented as distinct categories but lack an explicit, operational taxonomy. Readers will still be left unsure which term to use in what contexts because the post doesn't give clear axes (e.g., scope of tasks, performance relative to humans, agentic/goal-directed behaviour, economic vs social impact, ability to self-improve). Actionable fix: add a short taxonomy paragraph or a one\u2011line mapping that says for each term which axes matter and example operational thresholds (e.g., AGI = human-level across the majority of cognitive tasks; TAI = AI that meaningfully changes GDP/Growth rates; superintelligence = performance far beyond humans across nearly all domains). Even one compact sentence per term that references the most relevant axis will reduce ambiguity. \n\n2) The post leans on a few canonical definitions (Bostrom, Karnofsky, Cotra, Carlsmith) without acknowledging important, plausible alternative framings and the debates those definitions imply. That risks presenting contested choices as settled. Actionable fix: add a brief caveat noting major community splits (capability-based vs impact-based definitions; agentic vs tool AI distinctions; single-agent vs distributed/ensemble paths) and link to one or two short posts or papers that articulate contrasting views so readers who disagree can immediately see the debate. \n\n3) Important counterarguments and plausible pathways are under-emphasised. In particular, the post insufficiently addresses that: (a) transformative outcomes can arise from ensembles of narrow/specialized systems or from automation of R&D (tool AI) rather than a single AGI agent; (b) uncontrollability/strategic behaviour can appear even in sub\u2011AGI systems; and (c) the intelligence\u2011explosion/seed\u2011AI pathway is contested. Actionable fix: add 2\u20133 short sentences under \"Other terms\" or \"Caveats\" summarising these alternative pathways and why they matter for risk/policy framing, with one or two citations (e.g., work on tool AI/automation of R&D, critiques of rapid recursive self\u2011improvement, and examples of narrow systems producing large impacts).",
    "improvement_potential": "Useful and targeted: it identifies a substantive clarity problem (no operational taxonomy/axes) and the risk of presenting contested definitions as settled, and proposes concise, actionable fixes that won\u2019t bloat the post. Those changes would materially reduce reader confusion. Some of the suggested points (seed AI, PASTA, uncontrollable AI) are already present in the post, so the feedback is not completely novel, but overall it flags important omissions and framing issues that, if addressed, would noticeably improve the article."

    "explanation": "Overall clear and well-structured: the use of bullets, headings, concrete examples, and links makes the distinctions easy to follow. Weaknesses are moderate jargon and many links that can interrupt reading, a slightly awkward footnote/formatting marker, and no short summary that explicitly maps overlaps/relationships between the terms for quicker comprehension."

    "explanation": "This post is largely an introductory taxonomy pulling together well-known definitions and references from existing EA/AI-safety literature (Bostrom, Karnofsky, Cotra, Carlsmith, Ngo, etc.). For EA Forum readers the material is familiar and summarizes standard distinctions rather than proposing new ideas (hence a low score). For the general public it is slightly more novel because it collects and clarifies several related terms and lesser-known acronyms (APS\u2011AI, PASTA, t\u2011AGI, uncontrollable AI), but it still mostly restates established concepts rather than offering original claims."

    "explanation": "The post is logically structured and does a good job disentangling overlapping, informal terms and noting ambiguity \u2014 it cites relevant authorities (Bostrom, Cotra, Karnofsky, Carlsmith, Ngo) and gives useful examples. Weaknesses: it is primarily definitional rather than empirical, leans on community/online sources (and a Wikipedia link) rather than systematic literature or usage analyses, and doesn't deeply engage with contested edge cases or propose formal criteria for choosing among definitions."

    "validation_notes": "The post is largely accurate and well\u2011sourced for a definitions/terminology piece. Major claims (definitions and who introduced/uses particular terms) are verifiable in the AI literature and policy commentary: AGI as a contested term, DeepMind\u2019s Gato as a generalist agent often discussed as a 'step toward' AGI, Holden Karnofsky/Open Phil and Ajeya Cotra\u2019s definitions and examples for \u2018transformative AI\u2019/\u2018TAI\u2019, Nick Bostrom\u2019s definition of superintelligence, Carlsmith\u2019s APS (Advanced/Planning/Strategically\u2011aware) framing, Karnofsky\u2019s PASTA concept, the notion of \u2018seed AI\u2019/recursive self\u2011improvement, the Turing Test and Searle\u2019s \u2018strong AI\u2019, the LessWrong/GreaterWrong discussion of \u2018uncontrollable AI\u2019, and Richard Ngo\u2019s t\u2011AGI proposal \u2014 all are documented and match the characterizations in the post. \n\nCaveats: terminology is not standardized across communities (the post correctly states this), so some characterizations (e.g., \u201csome call Gato AGI\u201d) are context\u2011dependent and contested; media and researchers disagree about whether particular systems count as AGI. For a definitions primer, the post\u2019s empirical claims are well supported by reliable sources, with only minor nuance left implicit (as is normal for overview pieces).",
