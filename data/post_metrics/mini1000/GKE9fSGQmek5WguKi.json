    "explanation": "This is a practical, individual-level question about course selection rather than a general argument or claim that would shift community strategy. Good advice could modestly help a student's path into technical AI safety research (so it has minor importance within the EA/AI-safety pipeline), but it is not foundational or broadly impactful for humanity as a whole."

    "explanation": "I have no evidence that a person or pseudonym 'lamparita' is a known figure in the EA/rationalist community or publicly: no prominent publications, talks, or citations are associated with that name in my knowledge. If you can provide links or context (forum, posts, articles), I can reassess."

  "PostClarity": {
    "post_id": "GKE9fSGQmek5WguKi",
    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "Very easy to understand: short, polite, and asks a single clear question (which elective(s) are most useful for technical AI safety). It's concise and well-structured. Minor weaknesses: gives no background (current knowledge level, specific AI-safety area of interest, or career goals) and doesn't explain what aspects of the listed courses matter, so responses may be less targeted."

    "explanation": "This is a straightforward course-advice question about which ML classes are useful for AI safety research. Such practical queries are extremely common both within EA/AI-safety communities and among students generally, and it contains no new arguments, claims, or approaches."

    "explanation": "The post is essentially a request for advice rather than an argument: it presents no thesis, no structured reasoning, and no empirical evidence. Strengths: clear question and relevant course options. Weaknesses: no analysis of how each course maps to AI-safety skills, no citations or examples, and no criteria for evaluation, so there is no support for any conclusion."

    "validation_notes": "The post itself contains no concrete empirical claims \u2014 it\u2019s a request for advice about which electives to take \u2014 so there is little factual content to \u2018fact-check\u2019. The plausible implication that deep learning (and related topics like transformers, RL, and interpretability) is highly useful for modern technical AI\u2011safety work is well supported by alignment curricula and by job descriptions from major labs (which routinely list deep learning, transformers, RL, interpretability, and software/ML engineering as core skills). ([redwoodresearch.org](https://www.redwoodresearch.org/mlab?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [github.com](https://github.com/jacobhilton/deep_learning_curriculum?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [openai.com](https://openai.com/careers/research-engineer-scientist-interpretability/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Evidence also shows that \u201cadvanced algorithms / theoretical CS\u201d is important for many theory/verification/decision\u2011theory alignment strands (MIRI, CHAI, and Russell\u2019s work recommend rigorous math/CS foundations). ([intelligence.org](https://intelligence.org/research-guide/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [humancompatible.ai](https://humancompatible.ai/bibliography?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Computer vision is useful in subfields (robustness, vision RL, interpretability on image models) but is less central than general deep\u2011learning, transformers, or RL for much current alignment work focused on large language models and foundation models. ([redwoodresearch.org](https://www.redwoodresearch.org/mlab?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [github.com](https://github.com/jacobhilton/deep_learning_curriculum?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Overall: nothing in the post is contradicted by evidence; the main actionable claim (that Deep Learning is a valuable elective for AI safety research) is well supported, while the relative value of Computer Vision vs. Advanced Algorithms depends on the specific alignment subfield a student intends to pursue.

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Missing author context \u2014 The post gives no information about your background, goals, or constraints. Readers on EA Forum need to know your year, math/CS/ML coursework already completed, whether you want research vs engineering, and your timeline (e.g. undergrad vs grad, planning to do research soon). Action: edit the post to include 2\u20134 brief facts about your background and what you want to do with the course(s).\n\n2) Vague question scope \u2014 \u201cAI safety\u201d covers many subfields with different useful skills (alignment theory, interpretability, robustness, RL safety, ML theory, etc.). The current question treats the three courses as if they map cleanly to all of AI safety. Action: state which subareas you\u2019re most interested in, or explicitly ask for recommendations per subarea (e.g. \u201cfor interpretability and robustness\u201d vs \u201cfor theory/alignment\u201d).\n\n3) Narrow course framing and missing alternatives \u2014 You treat only three classes as options and don\u2019t say what each course covers. That will generate low-quality answers or irrelevant opinions. Action: either (a) give short syllabi/learning outcomes for each class if you know them, or (b) broaden the question to ask which foundational topics matter most and whether other courses (probability/stats, optimization, ML theory, RL, linear algebra, experimental ML) might be better prerequisites. This change will get more actionable, targeted advice.",
    "improvement_potential": "Clear, accurate, and actionable \u2014 the three points target real, consequential omissions (no author background, overly broad & ambiguous target area, and a narrow list of options). Fixing them would substantially raise answer quality while only slightly lengthening the post. Not a show-stopper if left alone, so not a 9\u201310, but these are critical improvements that the author should make."
