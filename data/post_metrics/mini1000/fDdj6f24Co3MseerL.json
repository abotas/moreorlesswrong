    "explanation": "This post proposes testable hypotheses about psychological traits that could help target and communicate EA-aligned animal advocacy. For the EA/rationalist community it is moderately important: if true, the ideas could meaningfully improve recruitment, messaging, and movement-building strategies and suggest useful empirical research priorities, but they are speculative, non-foundational, and easily supplanted by better evidence. For general humanity the impact is minor: the claims only pertain to advocacy strategy for a specific cause and would not substantially change large-scale policies or worldviews even if true. Major caveats are the absence of data, possible confounds (political orientation, social desirability), and risks of overfitting anecdotes to complex psychological traits."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Major lack of empirical grounding and an unresolved internal contradiction. You repeatedly present the idea as a hypothesis but publish strong directional claims and recruitment advice without a concrete empirical plan \u2014 and your own survey result (that openness/pragmatism correlated negatively with pro-animal attitudes) directly contradicts the central prediction. Actionable fix: either substantially soften claims (present purely as speculative) or add a short, concrete research plan / preregistered test you would want to run before making recruitment recommendations (e.g. measure Need for Closure Scale, Disgust Scale-Revised, Moral Foundations purity, Big\u20115, and political ideology in a representative sample of animal advocates; preregister specific predictions and controls). Explicitly acknowledge and try to explain the contradictory survey finding rather than dropping it into \u201cconsiderations to the contrary.\u201d\n\n2) Oversimplified and conflated psychological constructs (physical disgust, moral disgust/purity, authoritarianism, political conservatism, and need for closure). The post treats \u201cdisgust\u201d and \u201cabsolutism\u201d as unitary, black\u2011and\u2011white drivers but these constructs have multiple subtypes and are confounded with ideology and personality (e.g. purity foundation, authoritarianism, openness). Actionable fix: distinguish the constructs you mean (e.g. physical disgust sensitivity vs moral disgust/purity), cite the relevant literature briefly (moral foundations, DS\u2011R, NfC), and state which measures you\u2019d use and which covariates you would control for (political ideology, authoritarianism, openness, conscientiousness). This will prevent readers from accepting the simplistic mapping.\n\n3) Reliance on anecdote and surface cues that could cause reputational/selection errors. Using examples like Vitalik, Bruce Friedrich, dressing/hygiene, emojis, and plate\u2011sharing is high\u2011risk: these are noisy, culture\u2011dependent signals and could lead recruiters to exclude good candidates or to make embarrassing public claims. Actionable fix: remove or clearly label anecdotes as illustrative only, and replace behavioral recruitment heuristics with validated, low\u2011bias indicators (survey items, short behavioral tasks, or structured interview questions). Explicitly call out ethical/PR risks of basing recruitment on appearance or hygiene and recommend testing any informal heuristics before use.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback targets the post's three biggest weaknesses: the jump from speculative hypotheses to practical recruitment advice (and the author\u2019s own contradictory survey result), the conflation of multiple psychological constructs into an overly simple model, and the risky reliance on anecdotes and surface cues that could create reputational or selection errors. Each point is actionable (soften claims or preregister tests; specify measures/covariates and cite literature; remove or label anecdotes and replace heuristics with validated indicators). Addressing these would substantially reduce the chance of embarrassing mistakes and materially improve the post without requiring unjustified additional claims."

    "clarity_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The post is generally clear and well-structured: it states its goal and disclaimer up front, defines key constructs (need for cognitive closure, disgust sensitivity), and lays out observable signs and counterarguments. Strengths include explicit hypotheses, sectioning, and concrete behavioral indicators. Weaknesses are occasional mixing of anecdote and speculation with implied causal claims, some repetition across sections, and a few unclear transitions (e.g., how specific observations map to recruiting strategy); the inclusion of an image and informal examples also slightly reduce conciseness and professional tone."

    "novelty_humanity": 6,
    "explanation": "Most of the building blocks (need for cognitive closure, disgust sensitivity, the purity/disgust link to moral judgments, and how personality shapes political/activist preferences) are well-established in psychology and familiar to EA/longtermist readers. Where the post contributes some novelty is in combining those traits specifically to explain the absolutist vs incrementalist split in animal advocacy and proposing concrete behavioral markers for recruitment \u2014 a useful, but modestly original application rather than a breakthrough. For a general educated audience the specific trait-based framing applied to animal advocacy is less familiar, so the idea is moderately novel to them."

    "overall_support": 3,
    "explanation": "Strengths: The post lays out a clear, falsifiable pair of hypotheses and grounds them in well-known psychological constructs (need for cognitive closure, disgust sensitivity). It reasonably links trait-level motivations (desire for certainty, visceral disgust) to differences in absolutist vs. incrementalist advocacy styles and includes thoughtful caveats. Weaknesses: The argument relies heavily on intuition and broad generalizations (e.g., treating entire advocacy styles as psychologically uniform), offers limited engagement with alternative explanations (ideology, social signaling, strategic choice), and conflates different kinds of disgust (physical vs. moral) and moral reasoning. Evidence is sparse and low quality: mostly anecdote and unnamed surveys with no methods, measures, samples, or analyses; a single citation is used only to define a construct. Given the speculative framing, the thesis is plausible but under-supported. To improve confidence, the author should collect and report rigorous data using validated scales, control for political ideology and social desirability, and test causal mechanisms (e.g., experiments or longitudinal designs)."

    "validation_notes": "Partial support but not directly proven. The post\u2019s core hypothesis\u2014that high need for cognitive closure (NFC) and high disgust-sensitivity will predict preference for absolutist, disgust-maximizing animal-advocacy while low NFC and low disgust predict pragmatic/incrementalist approaches\u2014is theoretically plausible and supported by related empirical findings (NFC \u2194 dogmatism/authoritarianism/black\u2011and\u2011white moral processing; disgust sensitivity \u2194 moral condemnation and punitive attitudes; some links between disgust and meat aversion). However, I found no direct empirical studies that test those specific traits against the particular advocacy-styles (absolutist vs incrementalist) in animal\u2011advocacy communities. Important caveats from the literature (multidimensionality of disgust, domain-specific relations to politics, mediation by authoritarianism, mixed evidence on disgust \u2194 vegetarianism) weaken a strong validation of the post\u2019s specific claims. Many of the author\u2019s anecdotal markers (emoji use, hygiene, dressing changes) are speculative and not supported by published research. Vitalik donation cited in the post (\u2248$500k to EA Animal Welfare Fund in Aug 2024) is confirmed by press reports. Overall: plausible, partially supported by adjacent literature, but empirical claims about \u2018\u2018finding our people\u2019\u2019 need targeted primary research before being treated as validated.",
