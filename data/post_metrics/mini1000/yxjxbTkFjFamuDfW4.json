    "explanation": "The post appears to be a short summary/promotion of Giving What We Can\u2019s view on global catastrophic risks and recommended organizations. For the EA/rationalist community it is mildly useful \u2014 it can influence donor attention and funding choices but doesn\u2019t offer novel, load\u2011bearing analysis or arguments that would shift major strategies. For general humanity it\u2019s of low importance: it targets donors and practitioners rather than presenting new evidence or policy proposals that would materially change outcomes at a planetary scale."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Add concrete substance \u2014 the post currently reads like a headline. EA readers will expect specifics: name 3\u20136 organisations you recommend, give one-sentence summaries of what each does, and include at least one quantitative or qualitative reason you think each is high-impact (e.g. cost-effectiveness estimates, counterfactual impact, or key program evidence). Without specifics the post feels uninformative and unpublishable.\n\n2) Explain your selection criteria and key assumptions \u2014 state the decision framework (e.g. expected value, neglectedness, tractability), the major assumptions (probabilities, time horizons, moral weightings such as longtermism vs neartermism), and any exclusions. This prevents readers from inferring unstated or controversial priors and lets them judge whether your framing applies to them.\n\n3) Replace the vague CTA with actionable, verifiable next steps and sources \u2014 link to the Giving What We Can evaluation or selection methodology, provide direct donation links or a short \u2018how to get started\u2019 checklist, and cite any reports or external evaluations you relied on. Also add a short note on uncertainty and tradeoffs (e.g. why these risks vs other causes) so readers can see you\u2019ve considered reasonable counterarguments.",
    "improvement_potential": "Very useful \u2014 the feedback targets the post's core failures (it's only a headline with no specifics, no selection criteria, and a vague CTA). For an EA audience those are major omissions: readers will expect named organisations, concise evidence or cost\u2011effectiveness claims, and the decision framework/assumptions behind recommendations. Implementing the suggestions would substantially raise the post from uninformative to publishable. Minor caveat: following the advice will lengthen the post, but that can be managed with short summaries and links to sources."

    "explanation": "\"EA Handbook\" appears to be a collective/resource title or pseudonymous/organizational author (a guide for newcomers) rather than a single prominent individual. It is reasonably known within EA/rationalist circles as a reference but not a well\u2011known author or frequent public figure; it has virtually no recognition outside the EA community."

  "PostClarity": {
    "post_id": "yxjxbTkFjFamuDfW4",
    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The post is easy to understand, uses simple language, and states its purpose and call to action succinctly. It could be stronger by including brief specifics (examples of risks or organizations, selection criteria, or a clearer link) \u2014 as written it is clear but somewhat generic and minimal."

    "post_id": "yxjxbTkFjFamuDfW4",
    "novelty_ea": 1,
    "novelty_humanity": 3,
    "explanation": "The post is a very generic promotional blurb: it states that global catastrophic risks exist and that Giving What We Can highlights high-impact organisations. For EA Forum readers this adds almost nothing new (EA and longtermist communities routinely produce such profiles and guidance), so novelty is near zero. For the general educated public it's slightly more novel but still commonplace \u2014 public charities, media and NGOs frequently promote GCR-focused giving and donor guides, and the post offers no new arguments, data, or frameworks."

    "reasoning_quality": 3,
    "evidence_quality": 1,
    "overall_support": 2,
    "explanation": "The post makes a plausible but very high\u2011level claim (that global catastrophic risks are important and that Giving What We Can highlights high\u2011impact organizations addressing them). The reasoning is minimal: it states the problem and asserts a solution without defining key terms (e.g. what counts as 'high\u2011impact'), explaining how organizations were selected, or laying out causal pathways from donations to reduced risk. Empirical support is essentially absent \u2014 no organizations, metrics, cost\u2011effectiveness analyses, past impact, or external evaluations are cited. Strengths: correctly identifies widely discussed categories of catastrophic risk and aligns with mainstream EA concerns. Weaknesses: lack of detail, transparency, and evidence means the claim is weakly supported. To improve, the post should provide named organizations, selection criteria, quantitative impact or cost\u2011effectiveness estimates, and references to evaluations or modeling showing how donations reduce risk."

    "post_id": "yxjxbTkFjFamuDfW4",
    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 8,
    "validation_notes": "The post's core empirical claims are well supported. Giving What We Can explicitly lists \u201creducing global catastrophic risks\u201d (biosecurity/pandemics, AI safety, nuclear risk) as a recommended cause area and runs funds (Risks & Resilience, Emerging Challenges) that allocate donor money to organisations addressing those threats. Independent, peer\u2011reviewed and policy literature supports that pandemics, nuclear war, and advanced AI are widely considered global catastrophic/existential risks (e.g., Johns Hopkins on GCBRs; climate/\u2018nuclear winter\u2019 modelling; expert and institutional assessments of AI risk). Weaknesses: the phrase \u201cunprecedented scale\u201d is qualitative (but consistent with the cited literature) and numerical probability estimates vary and are debated; the post is high\u2011level and omits specific probability or impact quantification.",
