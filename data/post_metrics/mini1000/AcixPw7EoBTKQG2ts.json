    "explanation": "A call for survey participation is mildly useful to the EA/animal-welfare community because it can feed student research and possibly improve advocacy targeting, but it's not foundational or strategically load-bearing; its impact depends on study quality and uptake. For general humanity this is trivial \u2014 a routine academic survey with negligible broad consequences."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Provide researcher credentials, ethics, and transparency: say who you are (name, university/department), your supervisor, whether the study has IRB/ethics approval, and include a contact email. Link to any pre-registration, the analysis plan, and a clear data-sharing / anonymity plan. EA readers often treat anonymous Qualtrics links as low-credibility unless these details are present.\n\n2) Explain sampling, representativeness, and limitations: say who you are trying to learn about (e.g. current vegans, former vegans, omnivores interested in veganism), how you will recruit beyond the EA forum, and how you will handle selection bias (e.g. quotas, demographic questions, weighting, or caveats on generalizability). Don\u2019t imply advocacy recommendations will be broadly applicable unless your sample supports that claim.\n\n3) Give more survey detail and expected outputs: report the estimated number of questions and any validated scales you use, confirm approximate completion time and dropout protections, and state what results you will share (timelines, report vs. data vs. code). A short summary of the key constructs you\u2019re measuring (attitudes, identity, behavior, motivations) will help people decide whether it\u2019s worth their time.",
    "improvement_potential": "This feedback targets major, practical omissions that materially reduce credibility and uptake on EA: lacking researcher ID/ethics/preregistration, no sampling or bias discussion, and no survey detail or sharing plan. Fixing these is likely to substantially increase trust and response quality and can mostly be done with brief additions (so it\u2019s high-impact without being overly long)."

    "explanation": "I don\u2019t recognize the pseudonym 'sada_rice' from major EA/rationalist venues, publications, or prominent online discussions in my training data. There\u2019s no indication of notable visibility within EA circles or the broader public, so they appear to be an unknown or very minor online user."

    "post_id": "AcixPw7EoBTKQG2ts",
    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "Overall very clear: concise call-to-action with link, purpose (categorize veg-related subcultures), time estimate (~20 min), and eligibility (18+, need not be fully vegan). Well structured and easy to follow. Minor weaknesses: lacks details on researcher affiliation/credentials or ethics/privacy (IRB, anonymity), no incentive or target sample info, and 'veg-related subcultures' could be briefly defined for added precision."

    "novelty_ea": 2,
    "novelty_humanity": 3,
    "explanation": "Inviting people to take a survey about veganism and segmenting veg-related subcultures for advocacy is a fairly standard research/advocacy activity. EA readers in particular commonly encounter similar studies, datasets, and calls for participant recruitment, so it\u2019s not novel to that audience. It\u2019s slightly more novel to the general public only in the sense of targeted subcultural segmentation and explicit linkage to advocacy optimization, but still a routine research request rather than an original idea."

    "reasoning_quality": 4,
    "evidence_quality": 1,
    "overall_support": 3,
    "explanation": "The post makes a plausible claim \u2014 that a survey could categorize veg-related subcultures and that findings might help advocacy groups \u2014 but provides almost no methodological detail or prior evidence to justify that outcome. Reasoning is thin but coherent: a targeted survey can yield useful descriptive insights. Major weaknesses: no information on questionnaire design, sampling strategy, sample size or representativeness, validity/reliability of measures, analysis plan, or ethical/IRB oversight. There is also no empirical evidence or pilot data presented to show the survey will produce actionable or generalizable results, and self-selection and forum-based recruitment risks strong bias. Overall the idea is reasonable but weakly supported as presented."

    "validation_notes": "Most factual claims in the post are verifiable and supported: the EA Forum post by user 'sada_rice' exists and links to an active Qualtrics survey on an FAU subdomain; the author is a PhD student at Florida Atlantic University working on projects that match the survey description. Cross-posting on Reddit confirms the survey was actively recruiting in March\u2013April 2025. Weaknesses: I could not load the survey content directly (Qualtrics page requires JavaScript), I found no published results yet, and there is no public IRB/ethics approval statement visible online for this specific survey \u2014 and the claim that the findings \u201cwill help advocacy groups \u2026 organize their work more efficiently\u201d is an intended/aspirational outcome rather than an established fact. Overall: most concrete, checkable claims are supported; speculative claims remain unproven.",
