    "explanation": "This is a small, local pilot survey (n=36) that is useful for building regional capacity, adapting global survey instruments to Mexico, and informing preliminary policy advocacy \u2014 but it is not load-bearing for global EA or AI-safety agendas. If scaled and replicated nationally with better sampling and analysis, it could become more important for Mexican governance decisions, but as posted its conclusions have limited generalizability and little impact on broader humanity-level priorities."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Avoid overgeneralizing from a tiny, non\u2011representative pilot sample. You repeatedly characterize the results as a \u201csignificant consensus\u201d and make policy\u2011relevant claims (need for regulation, AI Safety agency). With N=36 drawn mainly from a few universities/research centers, those claims are not supportable beyond the surveyed group. Actionable fix: explicitly label results as preliminary and local, remove or substantially soften policy claims, and add a short paragraph with concrete plans for a nationally representative follow\u2011up (target sample size, stratification variables, power calculation).  \n\n2) Add essential methodological transparency and validation checks. The post lacks crucial details: exact sampling/recruitment procedure, the survey instrument (questions), translation/back\u2011translation procedure, pretesting results, and any reliability/validity statistics. Actionable fix: include or link to the full questionnaire as an appendix, report response rates and recruitment method, report simple reliability metrics (e.g., Cronbach\u2019s alpha for multi\u2011item scales) or item\u2011level agreement, and describe how translations preserved meaning (back\u2011translation or bilingual review). Even brief methodological tables or a short Methods paragraph will substantially increase credibility without lengthening the narrative much.  \n\n3) Address likely sources of bias and framing effects. The pilot sampled academics and researchers, which creates selection bias (higher technical literacy and possibly different risk perceptions), plus potential social desirability or leading\u2011question effects from adapting ESPAI/AI Impacts items. Actionable fix: add a concise limitations subsection calling out sample bias, question framing, and potential interviewer effects; describe mitigation strategies for the national survey (quota/stratified sampling to include non\u2011academic populations, randomized question wording or neutral framing, and planned qualitative follow\u2011ups to triangulate results).",
    "improvement_potential": "Highly useful \u2014 the feedback calls out the main weaknesses an author would be embarrassed by (overclaiming from N=36, missing methods/validation, and unacknowledged selection/framing biases) and gives concrete, low\u2011burden fixes (soften claims, add a short Methods appendix/link, report simple reliability stats, and include a brief limitations + plan for a representative follow\u2011up). Implementing these would substantially increase credibility without greatly lengthening the post."

    "explanation": "I can't identify a notable person named Janeth Valdivia in EA/rationalist communities or as a globally recognized public figure as of mid\u20112024. The name does not appear linked to major EA publications, speakers, or widely cited work; it may be a private individual or pseudonym. If you have more context (links, field, works), I can reassess."

    "clarity_score": 7,
    "explanation": "Overall the post is readable and well-structured: objectives, collaborators, methods, and outcomes are presented clearly and reviewer feedback is included. Weaknesses include some repetition (multiple restatements of origins and references), long acknowledgements that dilute the core message, and vague reporting of results (a claim of consensus but few concrete statistics and limited discussion of limitations beyond sample size). Tightening redundant passages and summarizing key findings with brief data would make it more concise and compelling."

    "explanation": "This is primarily an applied, local replication/adaptation of existing AI\u2011safety survey work (ESPAI / AI Impacts) rather than a new theoretical claim or framework. The most novel elements are the geographic/local adaptation to Yucat\u00e1n/Mexico, the institutional collaboration, and the pilot\u2019s concrete policy-facing framing; however the methods, core findings (concern about misuse, support for regulation/agency) and overall approach are familiar to EA readers and only moderately new to the general public."

    "reasoning_quality": 5,
    "evidence_quality": 3,
    "overall_support": 4,
    "explanation": "Strengths: The post states a clear and appropriate aim for a pilot (testing/questions adaptation), documents the adaptation of previously used instruments (ESPAI/AI Impacts), and narrates a reasonable project workflow with institutional collaboration and peer review\u2014these lend some internal coherence and plausibility. Weaknesses: The argumentation overreaches when presenting a \u201cconsensus\u201d about regulation and an AI safety agency given a tiny (n=36), convenience sample concentrated in a few research centers; the post lacks crucial methodological details (sampling/recruitment, demographics, exact items, reliability/validity checks, analysis/statistics) and does not address selection or response biases. Reviewers also flagged these limits. In short, the reasoning is acceptable for justifying a pilot, but the empirical evidence is too limited and underspecified to support broader claims about Mexican public or academic opinion or to inform policy without much larger, more rigorous follow-up."

    "validation_notes": "Most major factual claims are verifiable and supported by trustworthy sources: the EA Forum post itself (authors, text) is public; the arXiv paper (\u2018Thousands of AI Authors\u2026\u2019) and AI Impacts/ESPAI materials the authors cite exist; the COMIA 2025 conference (acceptance/presentation) and local institutional collaboration (UPY and Centro GEO) are corroborated by multiple news outlets and the COMIA program. Weaknesses: I could not find a publicly available copy of the submitted/accepted poster or a Research in Computing Science (RCS) article with the full survey data, so numeric details (the reported N = 36 respondents and the exact quantitative \u201cconsensus\u201d measures) cannot be independently checked from public sources. Given that limitation but otherwise good corroboration, the post is well-supported overall but not fully verifiable on all empirical details. ",
