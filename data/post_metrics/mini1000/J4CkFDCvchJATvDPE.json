    "explanation": "This is a personal career-planning question that applies common 80,000 Hours/EA heuristics. It\u2019s moderately useful to the EA/rationalist community as an illustrative instance of tradeoffs about undergraduate timing and skills under AGI uncertainty, so it could modestly influence similar individuals' choices. It isn\u2019t load\u2011bearing for EA strategy nor consequential for humanity as a whole \u2014 if its conclusions are right or wrong the effects are mainly on the poster\u2019s own career outcomes."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) You treat 80,000 Hours\u2019 AGI timeline and probability range as a near-deterministic input to your choice (i.e. \u201cI need to bet AGI won\u2019t come soon because I don\u2019t have a degree\u201d). That\u2019s a major decision-driving assumption you should make explicit and test. Instead: plan under deep uncertainty by maximizing optionality \u2014 pick programs/paths that are easily reversible or that give you fast transfer options (e.g. undergraduate programs with flexible majors/minors, part\u2011time study, or routes leading to quick conversion masters), and sketch a simple decision rule for switching (e.g. if new evidence pushes AGI probability >X, move to Y). Concrete actions: make a 2\u20133 year timeline with switch points, and list which moves are low\u2011cost (defer, take online courses, research assistantships) versus high\u2011cost (full commitment to a 4\u2011year program).\n\n2) Your hard ranking of majors and the dismissal of mathematics as \u201cnot the best anymore\u201d looks too categorical and under-justified. That\u2019s an own goal because subject value depends on program strength, your comparative advantage, and complementarities (math+CS, math+econ, etc.). Rather than an abstract ranking, test personal fit and option value: run short, concrete experiments (4\u20136 week project-based MOOCs, a small coding project, a microeconomics problem set, and a math proof-writing exercise), seek local faculty or EA mentors to read your sample work, and evaluate which subject gives better research/internship access at the universities you can enter. Use those results to choose a major that balances personal fit, optionality, and signaling.\n\n3) You\u2019re overlooking practical alternatives and constraints (admissions timing, local program strength, funding, signalling) and missing a concrete contingency plan for \u201cAGI comes early.\u201d Add concrete near-term steps that increase optionality and signal ability: map application deadlines and entry requirements for Swedish/university-exam routes now; apply for research assistant or internship roles to build credentials; publish small projects or a coding portfolio; join local EA/AI policy groups to open career options in operations/policy; and create a short \u201cif AGI arrives early\u201d plan (e.g. stop/continue degree, pivot to policy/operations, accept short-term high-impact role). These concrete additions will make your post far more actionable and defensible.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback pinpoints the author's biggest mistakes: treating 80,000 Hours\u2019 AGI timeline as near-deterministic, making a categorical ranking that downgrades mathematics without sufficient justification, and lacking concrete, practical contingency/optionality steps (admissions, funding, signaling). These are high-impact issues and the suggested fixes (plan for deep uncertainty, run short subject experiments, map deadlines/low\u2011cost moves, and sketch switch rules) are concrete and actionable and wouldn\u2019t unduly lengthen the post. It could be improved by adding one or two specific example thresholds/switch-points and clarifying which low-cost options are feasible in the author's local context, but overall it addresses the key own-goals the author should fix."

    "explanation": "For EA Forum readers the post is not novel: it largely restates standard 80,000 Hours guidance (AGI timelines, skill types, preferred majors, minors, and cheap testing) and common longtermist tradeoffs. For the broader public it\u2019s slightly more novel because explicitly tying undergraduate major choice to probabilistic AGI arrival and ranking majors by longtermist/AI-resilience considerations is less widely discussed, but still not a highly original idea."

    "explanation": "Strengths: clear goal, well-structured thought process, awareness of uncertainty, sensible heuristics (test subjects cheaply, focus on durable skills), and use of relevant EA/80,000 Hours frameworks. Weaknesses: heavy reliance on a single set of EA sources, key premises (AGI timing, ranking of majors, how AI will reshape fields) are treated as more settled than they are, little empirical labor\u2011market or technical evidence, and limited personal-fit data or contingency planning\u2014so the arguments are coherent but under-supported by diverse empirical evidence."

([80000hours.org](https://80000hours.org/agi/guide/when-will-agi-arrive/)) The \u2018four types of skills\u2019 that will gain value as AI progresses and the recommendation to prioritise skills that are hard for AI, complementary to AI deployment, etc., are directly described in 80,000 Hours\u2019 skills article.

([80000hours.org](https://80000hours.org/articles/college-advice/?utm_source=openai)) However, the post misstates one concrete item from 80,000 Hours\u2019 \u201cWhich degree subject?\u201d ordering: 80,000 Hours lists mathematics first (then economics, computer science, physics, engineering, etc.), whereas the poster wrote an ordering that begins with economics (economics \u2192 computer science \u2192 engineering \u2192 political science). That is a clear inconsistency with the source. ([80000hours.org](https://80000hours.org/articles/college-advice/?utm_source=openai)) Also, the poster over-interprets some nuance about mathematics \u201cnot being the best anymore\u201d; 80,000 Hours flags uncertainty for coding/applied maths/STEM in the face of AI automation (i.e., more uncertainty than for some other skills), but does not flatly state mathematics is no longer the top option \u2014 so treat that claim as a partial/misconstrued inference. ([80000hours.org](https://80000hours.org/agi/guide/skills-ai-makes-valuable/)) Overall: most major empirical claims are verifiable and supported by the cited 80,000 Hours pages (well\u2011supported), with a small number of noteworthy misstatements/misorderings that lower perfect validation.",
