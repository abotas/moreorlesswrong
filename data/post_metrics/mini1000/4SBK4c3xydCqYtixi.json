    "explanation": "For the EA/rationalist community this post is moderately important: it collects useful internal lessons about stewardship (how messaging like the 'talent gaps' piece, pushing operations roles, and deliberate space-building shaped EA\u2019s development) that can inform hiring, strategy, and community-building. It is not highly load-bearing or novel scholarship\u2014it's anecdotal, partial, and mostly relevant to movement governance rather than core cause-area arguments\u2014so its truth would change some tactical decisions but not foundational EA beliefs. For general humanity it is essentially irrelevant: these are internal organizational histories with negligible direct impact on broader global priorities."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Major overclaiming and weak causal evidence \u2014 You repeatedly make strong causal claims (e.g. the 80,000 Hours \u201ctalent gaps\u201d post was \u201cthe single most important example of steering\u201d) without evidence. That\u2019s a large reasoning risk: readers will reasonably ask for counterfactuals and alternative explanations (Open Phil\u2019s scale-up, GiveWell/Open Phil timelines, macro trends in tech and philanthropy). Actionable fixes: tone down superlatives unless you can produce evidence; add concrete supporting data (EA Survey trends, EAG application text, hiring/payoff data, OpenPhil grant timelines, citation counts/views for the 80k post) or explicitly label the claim as speculative and say why you think it\u2019s plausible vs other drivers.  \n\n2) Heavy reliance on memory and anecdotes \u2014 The post is explicitly memory-driven and includes many assertions that could be fact-checked or shown to be selection/recall biased. That undermines credibility and invites correction. Actionable fixes: convert anecdotes into documented mini case studies: link primary sources (blog posts, forum threads, meeting notes, public timelines), add quotes or corroboration from people involved (or mark as unattributed recollection), and flag which parts are guesswork. Also get basic fact-checks (dates, roles, who did what) before publishing to avoid obvious errors and reputational risks.  \n\n3) Structural and clarity problems that reduce impact \u2014 Key terms and the post\u2019s purpose are unclear (what exactly do you mean by \u201cstewardship\u201d/\u201csteering\u201d? Is the goal to persuade that CEA/80k steered EA, to document examples, or to teach how to steward?). Several sections are stubs or meandering. Actionable fixes: open with a brief definition and a one-sentence thesis; for each case study use a consistent 4-part micro-structure (context \u2192 intervention \u2192 evidence of effect \u2192 plausible alternative explanations/takeaway). Either finish or remove stub sections. This will make the piece shorter, crisper, and much easier for readers to evaluate.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback pinpoints core weaknesses that would embarrass the author if left unaddressed: grand causal claims without evidence, reliance on fallible memory/anecdotes, and unclear structure/terms. Each point is actionable and would substantially raise credibility without necessarily bloating the post (tone down claims, flag speculation, add key citations or short corroborations, and apply a simple case-study structure). The suggestions address major mistakes and own-goals and are likely to produce large improvements if implemented."

    "post_id": "4SBK4c3xydCqYtixi",
    "clarity_score": 6,
    "explanation": "The post communicates a clear overall intent (to catalogue examples of community stewardship/steering) and is organized with headings and discrete case studies, so a reader can follow the high-level thread with some effort. However, it reads like a rough internal draft: the timeline and causal claims are often anecdotal and undersourced, some sections are fragmentary or labelled as stubs, and transitions/arguments are underdeveloped. The tone is informal and occasionally repetitive, which reduces persuasiveness. With tightened prose, clearer thesis statements for each case study, better sourcing and finished sections, it would be much clearer and more compelling."

    "novelty_humanity": 4,
    "explanation": "For EA Forum readers the post is largely a recounting of well-known internal history and familiar concepts (the 80,000 Hours 'talent gaps' narrative, CEA/80k campaigning on ops, the branding/aggregation of EA). Those audiences are likely to have already seen or discussed these examples and debates, so it adds little genuinely new insight. For the general public the specific anecdotes and timeline about how EA steered talent and operations are somewhat novel \u2014 most people won't have considered these internal movement-building details \u2014 but the underlying ideas (talent-gap campaigning, orgs pushing for ops hires, branding effects) are not especially original, so the novelty is moderate rather than high."

    "explanation": "Strengths: the post offers a plausible, insider-informed narrative and cites relevant posts/events (e.g. 80k talent-gap piece, CEA ops events) that could plausibly have steered community behaviour. Weaknesses: arguments are largely anecdotal and descriptive rather than analytic; causal claims (e.g. that the talent\u2011gaps post or ops push meaningfully changed career/hiring outcomes) lack counterfactuals, quantitative metrics, or systematic evidence; selection and confirmation biases are likely; alternative explanations (large funders, broader cultural shifts) are not addressed. Overall the piece is useful as a starting narrative but provides weak empirical or inferential support for strong causal conclusions."

    "validation_notes": "Most of the post\u2019s concrete historical claims are well supported by public records: Benjamin (Ben) Todd\u2019s \u201ctalent gaps\u201d post was published in Nov 2015; 80,000 Hours ran a talent-gaps survey in 2017 with the high marginal-value numbers the post cites; the operations \u201cpush\u201d (80,000 Hours article first published March 2018, plus related Tara Mac Aulay and Tanya Singh podcasts) and CEA\u2019s Operations Forum in May 2018 are documented; Open Philanthropy\u2019s origin as GiveWell Labs \u2192 Open Phil brand (2014) and later independent organization (2017) is on record; and CEA was incorporated as an umbrella org around 2012 while 80,000 Hours and GWWC predate it.

Those are plausible given community trends but not directly verifiable from the public sources cited; they should be treated as informed recollection rather than independently confirmed facts.
