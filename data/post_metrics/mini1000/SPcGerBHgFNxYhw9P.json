    "explanation": "This is a well\u2011motivated, practical reframing \u2014 'spillover/local altruism' \u2014 that is useful for people who want to improve local social capital and norms. For the EA/rationalist community it is moderately valuable: it offers actionable ideas for community\u2011building, norm\u2011setting, and local giving that complement EA tools, and it\u2019s worth experimenting with, but it is not foundational to EA priorities (it doesn\u2019t affect core longtermist or global health tradeoffs or AI risk strategies). For general humanity it\u2019s of minor importance: if many people adopted these practices it could measurably improve local well\u2011being, but scaling and empirical uncertainty are large, and systemic/policy change remains necessary for many big problems. The post is practical and interesting but not a load\u2011bearing theoretical breakthrough; its impact depends heavily on adoption and context and it omits empirical evidence and some equity/power considerations."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Overstates the size and reliability of \u201cspillover\u201d effects without evidence or boundary conditions. The post treats norm-setting and contagion as large, universally positive forces but doesn\u2019t cite empirical literature (peer effects, social networks, signaling, social norms, neighborhood effects) or say when the effects reverse or vanish. Actionable fix: add citations and/or short summaries of the strongest relevant findings, and state concrete, testable hypotheses (e.g., \u201cif X% of households host weekly open-house events, neighborhood volunteer rates will rise by Y%\u201d). Spell out mechanisms and expected magnitude and where you expect the idea to fail (heterogeneous communities, high-status signaling contexts, weak social ties).\n\n2) Neglects coordination problems and institutional complementarity. Changing a few individual behaviours probably won\u2019t shift local equilibria without either many adopters or supportive institutions (zoning, transit funding, policing, local business models). Actionable fix: acknowledge this explicitly and add a short plan for scaling or coordinating (target high-centrality people, partner with local orgs, run pilots, or pair behavioral changes with low-cost institutional interventions). Estimate how many adopters or what level of coordination you think is needed for an effect to be noticeable.\n\n3) Ignores plausible negative side-effects of consumption restraint and private \u2018norm-setting\u2019 interventions. Examples: reduced spending could shrink local services (hurting workers), change price structures in unintended ways, or backfire as status competition intensifies. Actionable fix: add a paragraph listing specific risks and simple mitigations (monitor local business revenues/tax effects, recommend phased pilots, offer \u201cguardrails\u201d such as keeping a minimum local business support budget or focusing on redistributive giving rather than blanket spending cuts). Also propose measurable outcome metrics (e.g., public-transit ridership, diversity of event attendees, local mental-health indicators, small-business revenue) so readers can evaluate whether interventions help or harm.",
    "improvement_potential": "This feedback targets three central weaknesses: overstating spillovers without citing evidence or boundary conditions, ignoring the need for coordination/institutional complements, and overlooking plausible harms from consumption restraint and private norm-setting. Those are major, potentially embarrassing omissions for the author and the feedback gives concrete, actionable fixes (citations/hypotheses, scaling/targeting plans, risk mitigation and measurable metrics). Implementing these suggestions would materially strengthen the post without forcing a complete rewrite, though it will require adding succinct empirical references and a short caveats/plan section."

    "explanation": "The post presents a clear, well-structured central idea (\"spillover altruism\") and supports it with concrete, relatable examples and a logical theory of change, making it easy to follow. Weaknesses: some claims are vague or rhetorical (e.g., size of effects, how spending caps would be set/enforced), a few phrasing choices are loaded, and the piece could be tightened in places or backed with more evidence to make the argument more compelling and actionable."

    "explanation": "The post packages familiar ideas (social contagion/norm change, prefigurative politics, voluntary simplicity, place-based giving, community-building rituals) into an EA-ish, impact-focused framing called \u201cspillover altruism.\u201d That framing and the explicit, strategic application of EA-style cost\u2013benefit thinking to local norm-setting is mildly original for EA readers. The concrete proposals (weekly open-invite gatherings, group runs, using public goods, a spending cap tied to median income, a local-altruism budget) are largely variants of well-known practices (religious/community rituals, civic engagement, degrowth/voluntary simplicity, local philanthropy). For general readers these ideas will feel familiar and common."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The piece sets out a clear, coherent framework (\"spillover altruism\") and plausible mechanisms (norm-setting, social contagion, network effects, diminishing marginal utility). The proposed interventions are concrete and tie logically to the stated goals. Weaknesses: The argument is largely speculative and descriptive rather than analytical \u2014 no formal model, no treatment of countervailing effects or tradeoffs, and little engagement with alternative explanations or literatures (social capital, norm diffusion, behavioral economics, urban economics). Key assumptions (magnitude and direction of spillovers, scalability, distributional impacts) are untested. Evidence: virtually none is provided \u2014 no citations, empirical studies, or pilot data \u2014 so claims about community-level impacts rest on intuition. To strengthen the case the author should cite relevant research, quantify likely effect sizes, address unintended consequences, and present pilot/empirical evidence or a plan to test the ideas."

    "validation_notes": "Most of the post\u2019s empirical building blocks are supported by high\u2011quality evidence: (1) alcohol causes large health harms and substantial \u2018harm to others\u2019; (2) many behaviours spread through social networks (obesity, smoking, spending norms); (3) group-based physical activity increases adherence and social support; (4) \u2018\u2018safety in numbers\u2019\u2019 and benefits from more walking/cycling are empirically documented; (5) income\u2013wellbeing relations show diminishing marginal returns but the exact plateau is contested. Evidence on social\u2011media harms is mixed (small-to-moderate associations, stronger for problematic use and for adolescents). Claims that specific interventions proposed (e.g., a weekly open\u2011house, a fixed local spending cap, or a 10% \u201clocal altruism budget\u201d) will produce the exact community\u2011level outcomes described are plausible in theory (via norm\u2011setting and network externalities) but are not directly tested at scale and therefore remain largely speculative. Overall: good empirical support for the core mechanisms, but several prescriptive claims need experimental or longitudinal evaluation in real communities before being judged strongly validated.",
