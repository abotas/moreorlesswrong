    "explanation": "Useful, practical resource for channeling early-career talent into high\u2011impact EA cause areas; could meaningfully affect some people's career trajectories and hence marginally increase effective labor supply to important domains. Not foundational or widely load\u2011bearing \u2014 if the list is wrong or missing items the broader consequences are limited \u2014 and it primarily affects individuals rather than broad societal outcomes."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) No transparent selection criteria or evidence of impact \u2014 The post repeatedly calls these internships \u201cpromising\u201d and \u201cimpactful\u201d but gives no methodology or metrics for those claims. Action: add a brief explanation of how programs were chosen (e.g., scope searched, inclusion/exclusion rules, what \u201cpromising\u201d means: past alumni outcomes, org track records, scale, leverage, or alignment with high-impact cause areas). If you don\u2019t have quantitative evidence, label the list as curated/subjective and note known limitations.\n\n2) Missing accessibility and feasibility information \u2014 The list likely varies hugely in pay, location, remote options, visa support, and competitiveness, which materially affects who can take the internships. Action: add (or tag) key attributes for each listing: paid/unpaid, stipend amount or range, remote/onsite, country/region, visa support or eligibility, typical applicant background/skills, and application deadlines. If adding fields for every entry is too long, add a short guidance paragraph saying how to assess feasibility and a link to a downloadable CSV for power users.\n\n3) No recency/maintenance and potential conflicts of interest \u2014 Readers need to know how up to date the list is and whether you or contributors have relationships with listed programs. Action: add a \u201clast updated\u201d date on the page, state how often you\u2019ll review entries (and how to report changes), and include a short conflicts-of-interest disclosure (e.g., whether the team has worked for or received funding from any listed organizations). This reduces credibility losses if listings are stale or biased.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback pinpoints three substantial, actionable weaknesses that meaningfully reduce the list\u2019s usefulness and credibility: unsupported claims of \u201cimpactful,\u201d missing accessibility/feasibility metadata (pay, remote/visa, competitiveness), and lack of update/COI information. Fixing these would markedly improve trust and utility and are implementable without bloating the post (short methodology note, per-list tags or a CSV download, and a last-updated/COI line). These are critical improvements \u2014 the post isn\u2019t hopeless, but it would be noticeably weaker and potentially misleading without them."

    "clarity_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The post is clear, direct, and well structured: it states the purpose, summarizes what\u2019s included, links to the full list and a practical guide, and ends with a call to action. Language is simple and easy to follow. It could be slightly stronger by briefly describing selection criteria or highlighting a few example internships to make the offering more concrete; there is also minor repetition of links."

    "novelty_humanity": 3,
    "explanation": "This is mainly a practical curated resource and application guide rather than a new idea or claim. Among EA Forum readers, similar curated lists and guides to high-impact internships/fellowships are common, so it\u2019s not very novel. To the general public it\u2019s slightly more useful than generic internship lists because of the focus on cause areas and recurring high-impact programs, but the underlying concept (curated opportunity lists + application tips) is still familiar and not highly original."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post offers a useful, plausible resource (recurring internships across relevant cause areas) and practical advice for applicants; the basic argument\u2014that these roles can be good options for people seeking impactful early-career positions\u2014is reasonable. Weaknesses: The post gives no transparent selection criteria, no empirical outcomes or impact metrics, and no systematic comparison to alternatives. Claims that the listed roles are \"most promising\" or particularly impactful are asserted rather than demonstrated, leaving potential selection bias and relevance gaps unaddressed."

    "validation_notes": "The core empirical claims are well supported: the Probably Good internship page and the accompanying guide exist and state that the listed opportunities are recurring, span multiple cause areas (global health, biosecurity, climate, AI safety, animal welfare, etc.), and include primarily nonprofits plus government, multilateral, and some for\u2011profit programs. Sampling multiple entries on their list shows many established, recurring programs (WHO, World Bank, UNFCCC, ECDC, Breakthrough Energy Fellows, Mercy For Animals, Last Energy, Charity Entrepreneurship, Rockefeller Foundation). The one caveat is that the claim \u201clikely to be great options\u201d is subjective and not empirically verifiable; likewise, \u201cmost are at nonprofits\u201d is consistent with the list but wasn\u2019t quantified (the page itself phrases this as \u201ca large share\u201d). Overall the factual/content claims in the post are accurate and verifiable from primary sources. ",
