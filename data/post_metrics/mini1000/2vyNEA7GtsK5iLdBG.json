    "explanation": "This post matters fairly importantly within the EA/animal-advocacy space because it alleges substantive overclaiming and non\u2011transparent edits by a funded charity (and by extension raises questions about the reliability of impact claims and evaluator oversight). If true, it could change donor decisions, evaluator reputations, and incentives for transparency \u2014 but it is narrow in scope (one campaign/charity) and not foundational to core EA/longtermist concerns. For general humanity it is low\u2011importance: it mainly affects donors, animal\u2011welfare stakeholders, and community credibility rather than broad public interests."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Provide direct, verifiable proof that the impact numbers were not corrected. Right now you link to the spreadsheet and say the calculations still credit millions, but you don\u2019t show the actual formulas or a before/after snapshot of the cells that compute the credited piglets. Add screenshots or pasted formulas demonstrating (a) which cells feed the impact calculation, (b) their values now, and (c) what they were before the alleged edit. Show the arithmetic that yields the \u201cmillions\u201d figure so readers can verify the claim without opening multiple documents.  \n\n2) Don\u2019t infer bad faith from the deletion without checking and presenting revision metadata or asking for an explanation first. You have useful recordings and download timestamps \u2014 but you should also (a) cite the Google revision history entry that shows the deletion and who made it (if available), or explain why that metadata isn\u2019t accessible, and (b) state that you asked Sinergia/ACE for an explanation and summarize their reply (or say you requested one). That keeps the post factual and avoids an avoidable \u201cthey must be hiding something\u201d charge.  \n\n3) Tighten the translation/grammar argument or soften it. You argue the Portuguese/English explanation is implausible because an earlier cell used \u201cby\u201d correctly, but that is a weak basis to rule out a translation mistake. Either (a) produce a short pattern analysis showing consistent English competence across many cells (to justify implying the team knew the difference), or (b) reword to present this as a suspicious inconsistency rather than definitive proof of dishonesty. This will make your critique more defensible and reduce the risk of an own-goal from overclaiming.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback identifies three concrete, high-impact weaknesses in the post: (1) the post asserts the impact calculations still credit millions but doesn\u2019t show the formulas/before-after arithmetic for readers to verify, (2) it infers suspicious deletion/bad faith without citing revision metadata or recording Sinergia/ACE\u2019s response, and (3) the translation/grammar argument is overreaching based on a single cell. Fixing these is straightforward, wouldn\u2019t greatly bloat the post if done concisely, and would substantially reduce the risk of an embarrassing overclaim and strengthen the piece\u2019s credibility."

    "explanation": "I don't have any record of a notable EA/rationalist figure named 'VettedCauses' in my training data \u2014 no major publications, talks, or widely-cited posts tied to that handle.

    "post_id": "2vyNEA7GtsK5iLdBG",
    "clarity_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The post is generally clear and well-structured: it states the claim under dispute, quotes Sinergia\u2019s response, and presents a chronological, evidence-backed rebuttal with links and screen recordings. Strengths include explicit quotes, concrete spreadsheet cell references, and a clear central allegation (misstated commitment + deleted column). Weaknesses are repetitiveness, dense footnote/linking that can overwhelm readers, some assumed familiarity with ACE/spreadsheet conventions, and a few places where tighter summarization or clearer signposting (e.g., a short TL;DR) would improve accessibility."

    "explanation": "The post raises familiar themes for the EA Forum \u2014 charity impact overclaims, spreadsheet/translation errors, and concerns about deleting evidence \u2014 so those ideas are not highly original to that audience. What is somewhat new is the specific, well-documented case (JBS ear\u2011notching claim, exact spreadsheet cells, timestamps/screen recordings) and the allegation of post\u2011hoc column deletion; those particulars add some novelty but not a fundamentally new concept. For the general public the topic is slightly more unusual because of the technical documentation and the niche subject matter (corporate pig\u2011welfare commitments), but the core claims (organizations misstate impact and may obscure records) are broadly familiar."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post presents a clear, coherent argument (claim \u2192 evidence of mismatch \u2192 correction \u2192 remaining incorrect impact calculations \u2192 suspicious deletion). It cites primary sources (Sinergia's response, the original spreadsheet, screen recordings, a downloaded copy, and JBS's report) with timestamps and specific cells, which makes the chain of facts verifiable. Weaknesses: The post stops short of showing the precise formulas or numeric lines tying the incorrect wording to the exact impact numbers (so the claim that millions remain improperly credited is strongly but not exhaustively demonstrated). It also infers intent from the deletion (plausible but not proven)\u2014alternative benign explanations (editing error, poor version control) are not fully ruled out. Overall, the reasoning and evidence are strong and persuasive, though a few more technical details (calculation traces and any direct correspondence) would make the case near-conclusive."

    "emperical_claim_validation_score": 7,
    "validation_notes": "Most of VettedCauses\u2019 empirical claims are supported by public evidence: (a) JBS/Seara did publish a commitment to eliminate \u201cmossa\u201d (ear\u2011marking) \u2014 Seara\u2019s site states \u201c100% da mossa abolida at\u00e9 2027,\u201d which supports Sinergia\u2019s defence that a commitment exists but with a 2027 deadline rather than a 2023 deadline; (b) Sinergia\u2019s public commitments spreadsheet (the ACE/Sinergia Google Sheet) still lists JBS as \u201cCommitted to banning ear notching in 2023\u201d, credits ~8.7M piglets and shows Sinergia claiming 70% of the credit \u2014 i.e. the impact numbers were not adjusted when the wording in the cell was changed; (c) VettedCauses\u2019 allegation that Sinergia/ACE deleted a column and made late edits is supported by the materials VettedCauses published (their review page and the screen recordings they link). One important nuance: Sinergia admitted the spreadsheet wording was wrong and said it was a translation/wording error; JBS\u2019s public materials show the commitment dated to 2027 (not 2023), so counting impact from 2023 is likely incorrect (or at least misleading) unless additional evidence shows the change took effect in 2023. I could not find a clear primary JBS source of the exact 2024 quote VettedCauses attributes to JBS (\u201cDifficulty in finding alternatives that ensure process traceability\u201d) \u2014 JBS has publicly discussed traceability challenges and traceability investments, but the specific phrasing attributed to a 2024 JBS admission about continued use of ear\u2011notching was not located in the sources I checked. Overall: good evidence supports most of Vetted Causes\u2019 major factual claims (spreadsheet miswording, unchanged impact calculations, deletion of column), some secondary claims (the exact 2024 JBS quote) remain unverified in the public sources I checked.",
