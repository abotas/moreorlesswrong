    "explanation": "This is a high\u2011leverage, underexplored framing for development work that is directly relevant to EA strategy. If the core claims are true, targeted changes in rich\u2011country policy (trade barriers/antidumping, visa rules, remittance costs, freezing illicit assets, consumer pressure, tech/knowledge spillovers) could produce very large welfare gains for millions at low direct philanthropic cost. The antidumping/catfish example (large household income losses from a single duty) illustrates the potential scale. For the EA community the idea is load\u2011bearing because it could redirect advocacy, hiring and funding priorities toward long\u2011distance policy levers and complementary advocacy efforts; for general humanity it is moderately important because implementation could materially improve many lives, but the post is not a complete, tractable plan \u2014 political feasibility, countervailing interests, and rigorous cost\u2011effectiveness comparisons with on\u2011the\u2011ground interventions still need more evidence and operational detail."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Over-generalising from selective examples / weak empirical backbone. The post leans heavily on striking anecdotes (Vietnam catfish, a few studies on visas and fair trade) and treats them as representative of the whole class of \"long-distance\" policies. That risks a large own-goal: readers will rightly ask whether these are cherry-picked or whether there are systematic estimates of aggregate effects and heterogeneity (which countries/sectors gain vs lose). Actionable fix: add or summarise systematic evidence (meta-analyses or cross-country studies) on the aggregate impacts of tariffs, anti-dumping duties, visa restrictions and remittance fees, and explicitly report heterogeneity and standard errors. If good systematic evidence is sparse, say so and propose narrow, testable pilots (e.g., estimate household-level welfare gains from removing a specific anti-dumping duty or from expanding a particular visa category) rather than claiming broad generality.\n\n2) Understates political tractability and EA's comparative advantage. The post assumes technocratic, targeted fixes are both feasible and a natural fit for EA without analysing the political economy. But trade, migration and financial regulation are shaped by powerful domestic interest groups, electoral incentives, and international reciprocity\u2014barriers that differ greatly by policy lever. Actionable fix: (a) map which specific levers are plausibly tractable to small technocratic interventions (e.g., remittance fee transparency rules, integration of payment rails between two countries, a narrowly defined business-visitor visa category), and explain why EA could influence those (existing networks, expertise, funders, links to DC think tanks). (b) For each suggested lever include a short plausibility check: key stakeholders, main political obstacles, likely allies, timeline and a realistic success probability. That will convert the proposal from high-level aspiration into an operational advocacy plan.\n\n3) Missing distributional and recipient-country political risks. The post treats removing \"harmful\" policies as net-win but does not consider how gains may be distributed (urban elites vs rural poor), how recipient-country policies and institutions may mediate effects, or how reforms could provoke retaliation or entrench elite capture (e.g., returned assets diverted, exporters harmed by sudden competition). Actionable fix: add a brief section that (a) discusses plausible negative or ambiguous outcomes and when reforms could backfire, (b) explains how to mitigate them (engage local partners, conditionality, phased/piloted changes, monitoring & evaluation), and (c) proposes measurable outcome metrics (e.g., household real incomes in targeted communities, remittance fee percentage reduction, export volumes and employment in affected sectors) so advocacy successes/failures can be tracked and compared to existing EA interventions.",
    "improvement_potential": "The feedback pinpoints three substantial weaknesses that are likely to be seen as embarrassing 'own goals' by the author: overgeneralising from vivid anecdotes, underestimating political barriers and EA\u2019s comparative disadvantages, and ignoring distributional/recipient-country risks. Each point is actionable (ask for systematic evidence or acknowledge its absence and propose pilots; map tractable levers with stakeholder/plausibility checks; add mitigation/monitoring for potential harms) and would materially strengthen the post without requiring an untenable rewrite. The only small gap is that the feedback could offer one or two concrete quick-reference sources or a template for the plausibility check to make implementation even easier, but overall it correctly identifies major mistakes and gives practical fixes."

    "explanation": "Well-structured and easy to follow: clear thesis, logical flow (do less harm / do some good / examples / objections / implementation), and concrete policy examples that make the idea tangible. Anticipates counterarguments and suggests next steps. Weaknesses: fairly long with some repetition and occasional jargon/assumed background (EA, DC advocacy processes), and a few claims could be tighter or better quantified. Could be more concise in places and end with a crisper, actionable call to action."

    "explanation": "The core claims (rich-country trade, migration and financial policies substantially affect development; remittances and anti\u2011dumping duties matter; advocacy in donor countries can be high\u2011impact) are well established in development economics and policy literature (e.g. Nunn, CGD, OWID, Open Phil). What is somewhat novel for an EA audience is the explicit framing as a distinctive EA strategy \u2014 \u201clong\u2011distance development policy\u201d \u2014 and the suggestion that EA should leverage its advocacy experience from animal/AI work to pursue narrow, technocratic US policy levers. For general educated readers these ideas are largely familiar and widely discussed in mainstream policy debates, so they are not very original."

    "explanation": "Strengths: The post presents a clear, well-structured argument for shifting some EA attention to \u2018long-distance\u2019 development policy, identifies plausible mechanisms (trade, migration, remittances, consumer pressure), cites relevant empirical studies and concrete examples, and anticipates tractability/comparative-advantage objections. Weaknesses: The evidence is selective and leans on striking single-case estimates (e.g., the Vietnamese catfish anti-dumping study) whose generalizability is uncertain; some claims (e.g., large wage impacts from consumer pressure, tractability of narrow technocratic reforms at scale) need more systematic corroboration. The post makes a persuasive case that this approach is promising and worth further investigation, but the empirical base is not yet strong enough to convincingly establish it as clearly superior or highly cost\u2011effective compared to established interventions."

    "validation_notes": "Most of the post\u2019s central empirical claims are supported by reputable evidence, but a few details are overstated or need nuance. Supported points: (a) Nathan Nunn\u2019s broader argument (advocate rich-country policy changes) is an accurate summary of his 2019 paper; (b) tariffs have declined globally over recent decades but tariff structures remain biased against lower\u2011income partners / less\u2011skill\u2011intensive products (literature by Nunn & Trefler, McCaig/Pavcnik and WTO summary); (c) anti\u2011dumping measures are an important and often large form of protection (many measures in force, duties can be tens to hundreds of percent, and WTO/World Bank data show hundreds of initiations/measures annually); (d) specific case evidence: the Brambilla/Porto/Tarozzi study of the 2003 US anti\u2011dumping action on Vietnamese catfish documents large negative household effects after duties (the duty margins reported were 37\u201364% and the paper documents significant slower income growth and exits from catfish farming); (e) remittances exceed official aid (Our World in Data / World Bank) and global remittance costs average ~6\u20137%; (f) visa restrictions reduce trade and can have nontrivial welfare effects (Umana\u2011Dajud 2019 finds meaningful trade/welfare effects); (g) fair\u2011trade certification evidence (Dragusanu, Montero & Nunn) shows benefits for producers in some contexts; (h) public R&D generates measurable spillovers (Myers & Lanahan estimate ~60% of spillovers located within the US). Caveats / inaccuracies: (1) the post quotes a \u201c40% average annual real per\u2011capita income decrease\u201d for Vietnamese catfish households \u2014 Brambilla et al. (2008/2012) document significantly slower income growth and large impacts from 37\u201364% duties, but the exact 40% figure is not straightforward to corroborate from the published paper (the paper reports large negative effects but communicates them primarily as slower growth and exit; the post\u2019s single large percentage appears to overstate or compress the paper\u2019s results); (2) the claim that anti\u2011dumping cases are \u201ctypically initiated by wealthier countries\u201d needs nuance: historically major users were advanced economies, but many developing countries (e.g., India) are also large initiators today (WTO/World Bank databases show substantial use by developing countries); (3) one consumer\u2011pressure example: Harrison & Scorse show large increases in Indonesian wages during the 1990s related to minimum\u2011wage policy and anti\u2011sweatshop pressure, but the post\u2019s \u201cminimum wage increased by 400%\u201d is a simplification \u2014 the literature reports large nominal jumps and large real\u2011wage increases for some groups but the magnitudes depend on measure (nominal vs. real, district variation). Overall: the post is well\u2011grounded in mainstream empirical work and its high\u2011level claims are supported; some numerical claims and causal attributions are simplified or slightly overstated and would benefit from careful quoting and nuance.",
