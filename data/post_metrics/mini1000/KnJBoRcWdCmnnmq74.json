    "explanation": "Moderately important for the EA/rationalist community: the post raises practical, load-bearing issues about due diligence, transparency, accountability, and norms for charity evaluation that affect donor decisions, reputational risk, and how reviewers operate; it suggests real tradeoffs (evidence tampering vs. bias and reduced accountability) and invites policy solutions, so getting this right matters to evaluation standards and trust. Low importance for general humanity: the topic mainly concerns nonprofit evaluation practices and community norms with limited direct impact on broader public welfare."

    "actionable_feedback": "1) You overstate the \u2018\u2018evidence tampering\u2019\u2019 risk and then treat it as a blocker without showing charity-specific evidence or considering cheap, standard mitigations. Actionable fix: cut back the dramatic framing (e.g. police-investigation analogy) and instead acknowledge this is plausible but likely rare; add concrete archival safeguards you\u2019ll use so readers see the risk is manageable (perma.cc, Internet Archive/Wayback, archive.today, and/or OpenTimestamps/blockchain notarisation; keep original screenshots + EXIF/metadata; store files in a timestamped read-only location such as a public GitHub release or Google Drive link with changelog). Say you will publish a time-stamped evidence log alongside each review. That both preserves deterrence and removes the argument for \u2018\u2018don\u2019t contact\u2019\u2019 as a blanket policy.  \n\n2) You omit well-established, low-cost procedures that let you contact charities while reducing bias and retaining accountability. Actionable fixes: propose a short, specific protocol you would follow (so community can evaluate it) \u2014 e.g. (a) email-only contact with a fixed template and deadline (5\u201310 business days) asking only for factual corrections and source pointers, (b) separate the outreach role from the authoring/evaluating team so personal impressions don\u2019t skew evaluation, (c) record and publish correspondence (or summarise it and link to a redacted transcript) and (d) disclose in the review whether the charity was contacted, responded, and what changed. Adding these concrete rules addresses your \u2018\u2018unconscious bias\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018accountability\u2019\u2019 worries without sacrificing accuracy.  \n\n3) You don\u2019t address legal and editorial risk-handling or how you\u2019ll present post-contact changes. Actionable fixes: (a) note whether you\u2019ve sought or will seek basic legal input on defamation/accuracy risk and how prepublication contact can reduce those risks, (b) state an editorial policy for corrections/updating (e.g. keep original cited evidence archived, publish an update log and date-stamps for fixes, explicitly label claims that were amended after charity contact), and (c) explain how you will treat cases where charities claim evidence is confidential (e.g. require an explicit statement that evidence exists plus a summary of why it\u2019s confidential and independent verification where possible). Including a short editorial/legal policy will greatly reduce reader uncertainty and increase trust.",
    "improvement_potential": "Targets major omissions and overstatements: calls out dramatic framing of evidence-tampering risk and offers concrete archival mitigations; supplies a practical, low-cost outreach protocol that addresses bias and accountability; and demands an editorial/legal policy for post-contact changes and confidential evidence. Implementing these fixes would materially strengthen the post without much added length and would correct important weaknesses\u2014though they don't indicate the post is fundamentally wrong, they are critical improvements."

Weaknesses: it is somewhat repetitive and occasionally verbose (long paragraphs and a noisy external search link), some claims (e.g. frequency of evidence tampering) are asserted without supporting data, and the core ask could be tightened (e.g. specify exactly what kinds of solutions or verification services would resolve each risk). Overall clear and organized but could be made more concise and precise."

    "novelty_humanity": 4,
    "explanation": "The post frames a familiar debate (whether to contact subjects before publishing) in the context of charity reviews. EA readers are likely already familiar with the tradeoffs (right-of-reply, bias from contact, accountability, incentives for disclosure, archival verification) from journalism, research norms, and prior Forum discussion, so it\u2019s not very novel to that audience. The most distinctive points are the specific worry about charities actively altering online evidence after being warned and the request for a trusted third\u2011party verifier for screenshots/archives \u2014 somewhat concrete but still extensions of existing concerns. To a general audience the combination of these concerns is a bit less commonly discussed, but still not highly original."

    "explanation": "The post lays out plausible, logically coherent concerns (evidence tampering risk, unconscious bias, and incentive effects) and shows awareness of trade\u2011offs and mitigations (screen recordings, archives). However the arguments are often qualitative and rely on assumptions about frequency and magnitude of harms without charity\u2011specific data or documented cases of the particular behavior they fear. Evidence cited is indirect (general evidence\u2011tampering examples, policing practice) and there are few concrete empirical examples, rates, or counterfactual analyses. Overall the thesis is reasonably argued but under\u2011supported by relevant empirical evidence and alternative mitigations are not rigorously evaluated."

    "validation_notes": "Overall assessment: Most empirical claims in the post are plausible and supported by trustworthy evidence, but some are qualitative or framed as absences of data (hard to prove) and lack precise quantification. Strengths: (1) The core claim that web content (including charity webpages) can be changed or removed after criticism \u2014 and that this poses a risk to investigators relying on those pages \u2014 is well supported by multiple documented examples and by technical limits of web-archiving (e.g., Wayback\u2019s robots.txt behavior).

([news.bbc.co.uk](https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1986635.stm?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [cnn.com](https://www.cnn.com/2002/LAW/01/13/enron.documents/index.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/e494cbc6ea4a40a15ca251b496b50eae?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) (3) The claim that investigators often avoid disclosing an ongoing investigation (to prevent evidence tampering or compromise) is consistent with police/investigative guidance in multiple jurisdictions and professional standards. ([gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/interviewing-suspects/interviewing-suspects-accessible?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [college.police.uk](https://www.college.police.uk/app/investigation/managing-effective-investigations?highlight=guidlines+to+investigating+and+prosecuting+rape&utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Weaknesses / uncertainties: (A) The post\u2019s assertion \u201cCurrently, there are no known statistics on how often charities alter or remove evidence in response to critical reviews\u201d appears correct in spirit (I found no systematic, peer\u2011reviewed statistic quantifying the rate at which charities specifically scrub or alter webpages in direct response to critical reviews). However absence-of-evidence claims are intrinsically hard to prove; there is some related empirical work about nonprofit web-disclosure practices and isolated studies showing organizations sometimes \u201cscrub\u201d content for political or reputational reasons, but not a comprehensive frequency estimate tied to charity critiques. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8735731/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [nonprofitquarterly.org](https://nonprofitquarterly.org/study-finds-widespread-self-censorship-in-the-philanthropic-sector/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) (B) The arguments about incentives and accountability are theoretically plausible and have supporting literature about transparency and accountability in nonprofits, but these are normative/incentive claims rather than tightly quantified empirical claims. ([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/14/5834?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Net judgment: the post is \u201cwell-supported\u201d on the main factual points (web content mutability; documented evidence-tampering examples; standard investigative practice to avoid disclosure). It correctly flags gaps in quantified data about how often charities specifically alter evidence after critiques, but that particular negative claim should be presented cautiously (e.g., \u201cI found no systematic studies\u201d rather than \u201cnone exist\u201d).",
