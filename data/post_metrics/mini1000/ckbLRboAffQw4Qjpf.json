    "explanation": "This is a practical, well-intentioned career/field-building post that offers useful tips and pointers (especially for people creating courses or resources in EA-adjacent fields like biosecurity). It\u2019s unlikely to be load-bearing or change major EA strategies \u2014 more of a helpful nudge and a small-capacity-building contribution \u2014 so it has modest importance within the EA community. For general humanity the post is largely irrelevant: it doesn\u2019t introduce new scientific or policy claims and its direct effects are limited to people involved in organizing, teaching, or growing EA-related programs."

The name may be a pseudonym or a very minor/obscure online contributor; I could reassess if you provide links or context (papers, posts, or platform)."

    "explanation": "Well-structured and easy to follow: clear purpose, useful context, and logical sections (personal effectiveness, running programmes, caveat). Arguments for creating resources are concise and supported by concrete reasons and links. Weaknesses: occasional minor typos/formatting issues, a few vague or promised-but-unshown items (e.g. \u201cupcoming\u201d content) and could be slightly tighter with more concrete examples or next steps for readers. Overall clear and readable but not perfectly polished."

    "explanation": "Most ideas in the post \u2014 create shareable resources from your work, document retrospectives, iterate courses, and be cautious about downside risks \u2014 are common advice within EA and related professional communities. For EA readers these are very familiar themes (hence a low score). For the general educated public the combination of explicitly framing resources as capacity-building for field growth and the specific caveat about \u2018choosing failures\u2019 is slightly less ubiquitous, but still not highly original."

    "reasoning_quality": 6,
    "evidence_quality": 3,
    "overall_support": 4,
    "explanation": "The post presents a clear, coherent and plausible argument: creating shareable resources can build capacity, lower barriers, and inspire others, and one should manage downside risks. The reasoning is logically sound and grounded in practical experience (the author\u2019s course and roles) and concrete process suggestions (e.g. iteration, feedback, contingencies). However, empirical support is minimal \u2014 there are no outcome metrics, case studies, or literature citations showing these resources actually produce the claimed effects or quantifying risks/benefits. The post is useful as well-informed, experience-based advice, but it is not strongly evidenced; stronger support would require impact data, counterexamples, or more detailed risk analysis."

    "validation_notes": "Most of the post\u2019s factual claims are verifiable and accurate: the author (Lin Bowker\u2011Lonnecker / Lin BL) is the co\u2011founder / Executive Director of Oxford Biosecurity Group and has posted the linked Substack/EA\u2011Forum pieces; the Introduction to Biosecurity course and the Oxford Biosecurity Group (including the 2024 activity summary numbers) are published on the OBG sites; Charity Entrepreneurship\u2019s rebrand to Ambitious Impact and the existence of BlueDot Impact, Meridian (formerly EA Cambridge), and the ERA Fellowship are documented. The post\u2019s prescriptive claims about the benefits of creating resources are normative/general (plausible but not strong empirical statements) and so are not strongly provable or disprovable. Minor ambiguity/overlap in one parenthetical (grouping \u201cCambridge Effective Altruism CIC (now Bluedot Impact, Meridian Cambridge, ERA Fellowship)\u201d) could be misread \u2014 Cambridge EA \u2192 Meridian is supported, while BlueDot Impact is a related Cambridge-origin education group but not strictly a straight rename of Cambridge EA CIC. \u201cPivotal Research\u201d is a generic name used by multiple organisations, so which entity is meant isn\u2019t fully specified in the post but this doesn\u2019t change the overall accuracy of the author\u2019s stated affiliations.

    "actionable_feedback": "1) Major missing discussion of dual\u2011use and safety oversight for biosecurity resources. You already note \u201cchoose your failures,\u201d but for a field like biosecurity this is an own goal: creating public resources (course materials, session plans, facilitator guides) can enable harmful actors if they include technical details or operational guidance. Before publishing, explicitly state how you will assess and reduce dual\u2011use risks (e.g. external expert review, removal/abstraction of actionable technical content, staged/controlled release, alignment with institutional review/ethics processes, or \u201csafety red team\u201d checks). Say which of those you will use for the course materials and how you will decide what is safe to publish. That both reduces real risk and addresses likely community concerns up front. \n\n2) Lack of clarity about intended audience, concrete deliverables, and measurable impact. The post promises resources but is vague about who they\u2019re for, what exactly will be published, when, and how success will be judged. Before publishing, add short specifics: target audience(s) and prerequisites; exact types of outputs (slides, facilitator guides, recordings, licensing); expected timeline; and a simple set of impact metrics you\u2019ll track (e.g. number of runs by external groups, learner outcomes, follow\u2011on engagement, pre\u2011registered evaluation plan). This will make the post more useful to readers deciding whether to collaborate or reuse your materials. \n\n3) \u201cChoose your failures\u201d is useful but underspecified for readers who may emulate you. Offer concrete decision rules and contingency plans rather than high\u2011level exhortations. For example: predefined stop/go criteria for risky initiatives, minimum levels of external review before public release, processes for maintaining/updating materials, who holds responsibility for downstream harms, and funding/staffing backstops to avoid abandonment. Adding 2\u20133 concrete heuristics or an example framework will make the caveat actionable and reduce the chance others copy a risky approach unintentionally.",
    "improvement_potential": "Strong, actionable feedback that flags a real 'own goal' (dual\u2011use risks) and two other substantive omissions (audience/deliverables/metrics and concrete risk\u2011management rules). Addressing these would materially reduce safety and reputational risks and make the post far more useful to readers, and can be done with only modest additions rather than a long rewrite."
